Although I think the breakthroughs that companies like Tesla and Apple are creating things that are revolutionary, I think these things are what people will take them for granted and doing that can cause accidents. Researchers from the University of Utah said. ""They found that performing multiple tasks while driving, such as following GPS directions or talking on the phone, caused drivers to be less alert."" This means that if they are not as aware if they weren't using these technologies than accidents could happen much more easily. 
 I think certain states like Texas who have looser laws on texting and driving should really reconsider how serious texting will driving is. Other researchers from Texas A&M University's Center for Transportation Safety said that they found ""that 1 in 10 Texas drivers were talking on a phone, texting, or using some other electronic device while driving."" This means if you were to take ten totally normal people from Texas and you let them drive around, about one person out of the bunch would be actively using some sort of electronic device on a daily basis. It only takes one person to create a large wreak. For example my dad and I got in a pile up coming over an overpass because somebody was distracted and this created a large inconvenience for a lot of people. 
 I really do think that the innovations people are making will have a great effect on us in the future but at the same time I still think that people can't just pay enough attention to where something like voice to text texting will help very much. I mean have you ever tried doing voice to text? They always mess up what you are trying to say and then you have to go back and fix all the type-os and just end up paying more attention to your phone.

Two recent tunnel projects have required engineers to come up with new and creative ways to dig tunnels.'' The Chunnel is the bigger engineering accomplishment because if someone needs to get to the united kingdom and could not get access to a boat or an airplane or helicopter or something that transports through the air or did not own a boat then there would be no possible way to get to the united kingdom.
 
 This is the bigger engineering accomplishment because it is important to have a convenient way to get to the United Kingdom, so they decided that it would be a good idea to build tunnels so that people could get there in a quick way by a car, truck, ""In the past, the only way to reach the United Kingdom was by water or by air. Today, trains carrying people, cars, and trucks speed through two tunnels under the English Channel. (Thereâ€™s a third tunnel in between the two main tunnels. It provides an emergency escape route.) Connecting France and England, the Chunnel was completed in 1994. ""
 
 
 Some people think that the Big Dig is the bigger engineering accomplishment, The reason they might think that is because there was a huge six lane highway that ran through the middle of Boston and then they decided to put in tunnels that were underground because the highway was so crowded, but it wasn't as easy as you think because Tunneling through a big city is difficult. Their solution for this was to use slurry walls. To build a slurry wall they use a machine to dig a trench, then the trench is filled with a mixture that is called slurry. They build starting from the bottom up, the machines start to fill them with concrete. Then they build the side walls, once that is done they put on a concrete roof. Then they excavate the dirt and build the tunnel. I think the Chunnel is the bigger engineering accomplishment over the big dig because In the past the only way to get to the united kingdom was by a boat or air but then the decided to build the Chunnel so that there would be a easier way to get to the united kingdom if a boat or airplane is unavailable to you. ""In the past, the only way to reach the United Kingdom was by water or by air. Today, trains carrying people, cars, and trucks speed through two tunnels under the English Channel. (Thereâ€™s a third tunnel in between the two main tunnels. It provides an emergency escape route.) Connecting France and England, the Chunnel was completed in 1994.""
 
 So in conclusion the Chunnel is the bigger engineering accomplishment, but some people may think the Big Dig is better but i do not agree that it is the better engineering accomplishment because in Boston they could still use cars on the highway that they had, also tunneling though Boston was difficult because over time as Boston grew it had created new land so that made it harder, But to get to the united kingdom you couldn't use a car to get there.

They had to deal with dirt collapses and mining through tough stone, but they finished it. They also had to go through the Historical Fill which was where there was flooding and collapsing dirt.
 To start things off, The Big Dig had to deal with collapsing dirt. The type of dirt they were digging through was soft and collapsed easily. To fix this they created slurry walls. Slurry walls are a special digging machine that digs a trench. The trench is filled with a watery mixture called slurry.
 Secondly, they had to mine through tough stone. When the workers were using the slurry machine they would have to go through tough rock and stone. It was not easy by hand but with the machine it was a bit easier.
 Lastly, the workers had to deal with the Historical Fill. The Historical Fill was when there was a lot of rain and Boston flooded. This made it even harder to mine because there would be the collapsing dirt and the flooding. 
 This concludes my reason on why the Big Dig was a great engineering project. They had to deal with collapsing dirt, flooding, and they invented slurry walls. But in the end they came through with a new way to travel in Boston.

I know The Chunnel was a bigger engineering accomplishment, and Iâ€™ll show you why in this essay.
 
 I know this because in order to reach the uk via tunnel, they had to cross had to make a tunnel underwater while the big dig simply had some watery dirt. Quote from the text â€œthey also had to find a way to keep the tunnel from collapsing under the weight of the water above. It had to be strong and water proofâ€. This is proof they had to do it under water
 
 Another reason why the Chunnel was a bigger engineering achievement is because they has to dig through solid rock, while the big dig had to drain some slurry to place a bridge. Proof that they had to dig through rock - â€œNot only did engineers have to dig through solid rock,â€
 
 The third reason why the Chunnel is a bigger 
 engineering accomplishment than is because the Chunnel connected 2 entire countries, while the big dig has to make a tunnel going around Boston. Using proof from the text - â€œConnecting France and England, the Chunnel was completed in 1994.â€œ A ocean between 2 countries is a better than a tunnel going around a city.
 
 My final piece of evidence is that the Chunnel was the first way on ground between France and the uk. Proof from the text - â€œIn the past, the only way to reach the United Kingdom was by water or by air.â€, â€œConnecting France and England, the Chunnel was completed in 1994.â€
 These 2 sentences from the text are proof that that bridge was the first between us and France, which is a huge engineering accomplishment.
 
 This is why the Chunnel is a bigger, and better, accomplishment than the big dig. I hope this was enough to make you agree, and thank you for reading.

This enormous collection of tunnels would replace the huge, six-lane elevated highway that ran right through the middle of Boston. Traffic would travel through a series of tunnels on highways that were completely underground. Sounds great, right? But tunneling through the middle of a big city is difficult. And Boston had its own, unique problems. Over the decades, as Boston grew and spread, it had created new land by filling in water with rocks and dirt. This â€œhistorical fillâ€ was soft, and it collapsed easily when engineers tried to dig through it.
 
 The solution? Engineers used what are called slurry walls. To build a slurry wall, a special digging machine digs a trench. The trench is filled with a watery mixture called slurry. Building from the bottom up, machines fill the trench with concrete. After the side walls are built, workers put a concrete roof in place. Then the rest of the dirt can be excavated to create the tunnel.
 
 But the slurry method couldnâ€™t be used everywhere in the Big Dig. In some places, premade tunnels were inched into place using giant machines. It was like sliding a huge straw into a hole.
 
 The Chunnel
 In the past, the only way to reach the United Kingdom was by water or by air. Today, trains carrying people, cars, and trucks speed through two tunnels under the English Channel. (Thereâ€™s a third tunnel in between the two main tunnels. It provides an emergency escape route.) Connecting France and England, the Chunnel was completed in 1994. Chunnel construction was difficult for many reasons. Not only did engineers have to dig through solid rock, but they also had to find a way to keep the tunnel from collapsing under the weight of the water above. It had to be strong and waterproof.
 
 To dig, engineers used huge tunnel-boring machines. These machines have cutting heads covered with sharp teeth. The borers chewed through rock to create the tunnel. Then concrete liners were installed to support the tunnel walls. These liners are actually many rings of concrete, lined up and attached to each other, creating a tube.

 If you had the option between riding underground or underground beneath the ocean in a tunnel, which would you feel more safe and secure in? Comparing the two tunnel designs it's obvious that the Chunnel is the biggest engineering accomplishment considering that it was built underneath the ocean.
 The high pressures of the ocean put everything at an extreme risk. One mistake can possibly destroy the tunnel and risk the lives of many people.
 
 
 Unlike the Big Dig, the Chunnel had to tunnel through solid rock and under the intense pressures of the ocean which meant that it had to be strong and waterproof.
 The Chunnel article states that the engineers had to dig through solid rock, but they also had to find a way to keep the tunnel from collapsing under the weight of the water above, and that It had to be strong and waterproof. In order to solve this problem, the engineers used concrete rings attached together to support a waterproof tube lining the tunnel. This made construction of the tunnel more complicated and probably much more costly. Especially, considering the distance of constructing the tunnel between England and France.
 
 
 Some might believe that the Big Dig was the bigger achievement because it had to replace the six lane highways with underground tunnels through the center of Boston. The large volume of the work that was required for the Big Dig, and the land problems that had to be overcome may make some feel that it was the bigger accomplishment. Although, these tunnels were mainly constructed through the center of Boston compared to the Chunnel, which was made up of 3 tunnels, one of which was an escape tunnel, and was constructed over a much larger distance, and under the ocean. The evidence clearly supports the greater accomplishment of the Chunnel's success.
 
 
 The distance of the Chunnel and the danger of constructing it under the ocean made it a great accomplishment. It was built under the extreme pressures of the ocean, and had to be waterproof. The Chunnel was 3 tunnels drilled through solid rock through a large distance between England and France.

 The chunnel is a tunnel that is connected to France and England. This underground tunnel today has trains that carry people, cars, and trucks through two tunnels under the English channel (France & England). ""Chunnel construction was difficult for many reasons. Not only did engineers have to dig through solid rock, but they also had to find a way to keep the tunnel from collapsing under the weight of the water above.

To dig even further underground, constructors had to use a device called a tunnel-boring machine that cut through rocks with sharp teeth.
 
 Some may argue that projects like The Big Dig was an even greater accomplishment than The Chunnel because this project was also hard to carryout so they used 'slurry walls' to digs trench's to finish the operation But the Chunnel still had much more complications making it a bigger achievement than the Big Dig.
 
 In short I would say that The Chunnel was a bigger accomplishment than The Big Dig could ever be.""""",,,,,,,

States and cities are often restricting their use for drivers behind the wheel, but technology companies and other advocates are confident that new devices can help make the roads safer. Â«You get to a point where an innocent person is getting killed by someone texting, and at that point I think you don't have the right to text while driving,Â» she said. Distracted driving is common in Texas, studies suggest.
 
 Research done in 2012 by Texas A&M University's Center for Transportation Safety found that 1 in 10 Texas drivers were talking on a phone, texting, or using some other electronic device while driving. Texas is one of nine states without a statewide ban on texting while driving. In addition, the Texas Department of Transportation has launched statewide awareness campaigns. The department has a texting and driving simulator that shows how dangerous it can be to drive distracted.
 
 Manufacturers like Audiovox make gadgets that drivers can operate through voice commands to place hands-free phone calls, use GPS, and even send text messages. Farther down the road, automakers and electronics companies see the Â«connected car,Â» a vehicle that communicates with other cars and with the road itself to help mitigate the risks of inattentive drivers. McCullough said competition among companies like Tesla, Apple and Google is driving innovation that will make driving safer than laws alone could. But studies suggest some technology designed to decrease distraction has the opposite effect.
 
 Researchers at the University of Utah measured brain activity of drivers while using various hands-free devices. They found that performing multiple tasks while driving, such as following GPS directions or talking on the phone, caused drivers to be less alert. Â«We've got to have these laws.""""",,,,,,,

You most likely do, that is because they are all around us and we see and use them every day. The first known tunnel was built in 1843 the purpose was to make travel easier. The design of the tunnel was inspired by a burrowing animal, and was created by Marc Isambard Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel. One of the most famous tunnels in history was the Chunnel. The Chunnel was a big engineering accomplishment that was created in 1994, It was a very big and difficult project because it went underwater.This is one of the reason that the Chunnel was a big Engineering accomplishment. 
 
 
  The Chunnel was a very big accomplishment this is because the worker had too drill through solid rock which is very difficult to do. But the biggest challenge they faced was that the tunnel had too go underwater. They had too design the tunnel so that the walls would support the weight and pressure of the water. According too the text. ""Chunnel construction was difficult for many reasons. Not only did engineers have to dig through solid rock, but they also had to find a way to keep the tunnel from collapsing under the weight of the water above. It had to be strong and waterproof."" This quote from the text shows how there where things that had too be added to the build to withstand the water like having waterproof walls.
 
 
 
  On the other hand, you may have heard of another famous tunnel called ""The Big Dig."" When being compared too the Chunnel some may say that The Big Dig was a bigger accomplishment, However I disagree. An argument that might be made defending The Big Dig, is that they had too construct the tunnel in the middle of a city causing many problem.But The Chunnel Was one of the first underwater tunnels ever created, which means that there was not a lot of advancements made too make the construction easier.Also the Chunnel had parts in cites as well since it connected France and England.
 
 
 
 
  In conclusion, The Chunnel is a bigger engineering accomplishment than The Big Dig.This is because of the challenges that the builders had too face because the tunnel was underwater.Which caused many extra things like waterproof walls too be added.Which made the project much harder for all the workers and designers.

 The Channel Tunnel runs from UK (United Kingdom) To France 
 So it was a long tunnel!

 ""Chunnel construction was difficult for many reasons. Not only did engineers have to dig through solid rock, but they also had to find a way to keep the tunnel from collapsing under the weight of the water above. It had to be strong and waterproof.""
  My Reasoning for this evidence is.
  this channel tunnel was harde to make because it needed so much knowledge of engineering and resources, and it took 5 yrs to build the channel tunnel. and the big dig tunnel even tho it took 7 yrs to build the big dig it was just a normal tunnel, but in the other hand the channel tunnel had more problems that were fixed. 
 
 Its a Train Station!
 Runs from the UK to France, France To UK.
 In My Conclusion is that the reason that the channel tunnel was hard to make is because it took 5 yrs and they had to build under water and a weird type of dirt that kept collapsing. so it took more engineering skills.
