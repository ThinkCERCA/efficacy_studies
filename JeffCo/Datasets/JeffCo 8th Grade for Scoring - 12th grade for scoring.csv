14520968,10/23/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Beverly Brackney,XDGNFW,Anwar Abdulnur,NULL,""" I think they should pursue a major focused on technical skills rather than liberal arts education. With liberal arts education, you are focusing on a multitude of subjects, while with a technical skills education, you focus on doing one specific skill.
   People who major in technical skills make more money than people with degrees in liberal arts education. As stated in the article, ""In Tennessee, a graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology, one of the stateâ€™s most common majors, makes around $40,000 a year less than a bachelorâ€™s graduate in computer or electrical engineering."" There is a definite financial benefit in majoring in a technical skill, if that's what you mostly care about. Another fact taken from the article is, "" In Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degree â€” and an average annual wage that is about half that of an associateâ€™s graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenance."" As you can see, it is not just Tennessee that someone who majors in technical skills- it is state-wide.
 Some people might suggest that people who have a degree in liberal arts have more satisfaction in their job than someone with a degree in technical skills. Although, in the article, it says, ""Gallup has polled working graduates to gauge their job satisfaction and engagement in their communities. It has found that there are no differences in satisfaction levels of associateâ€™s graduates compared with bachelorâ€™s graduates."" Which mean there is no discrepancies in job satisfaction between having a job that requires a degree in liberal arts and a job that requires a degree in technical skills. 
 All in all, having a technical skills degree is more beneficial financially and has no known discrepancy in job satisfaction. At the end of the day, though, do what makes you happy and what you are most confident in doing.""""",,,,,,,
15042796,1/21/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Beverly Brackney,XDGNFW,Anwar Abdulnur,NULL,"""When I hear that a college is test optional I think one thing- exclusive. Without test scores to look over and chose from, it causes the school to be more selective in their application process. Now don't get me wrong, it sounds like a good idea at first for kids that don't have the resources to take tests and score well. But when you put it into perspective, it makes the college's look harder in the application process to decide the students they want to attend their school.
 Being a test-optional school is in no way a bad thing. But in a way, it is not good either. Being test-optional means one thing- you're going to have more students applying to attend your college. What that does is makes the colleges be more selective when accepting students into their college. If they were test-mandatory, it would be easier for them. Just pick the students with the highest test scores and grades and leave it at that. Like the article states, ""Test-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. Thatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective."" You can't accept everyone that applies. It's not that easy.
 With being test-optional, it creates more selectivity based on that fact that people will still elect to take tests in order to become more likely to be accepted. That leaves the people that haven't taken the test at a disadvantage because it's a simple decision. Would you rather want to accept a student that has taken a test and scored well or not taken the test at all? In the article it says, ""We also found a 25-point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower-scoring students keep their scores to themselves. This results in higher average scores being reported to the federal government and magazines that publish college rankings. Thus, it appears as though by increasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieve.""
 Now some people might say that being test-optional allows more opportunities for kids that don't have the same resources as others. I would disagree for the simple reason that in some cases being a test-optional school means nothing. It's just a blanket colleges use to showcase that their school is inclusive, when in reality it's the exact opposite. Matter of fact, they would be more selective than a school that is test-mandatory.
 All in all, there is always more to be done to be more inclusive. Just doing one thing isn't going to solve the problem. There are multiple steps to becoming more inclusive. You have to start somewhere.

Especially if thatâ€™s what they want to do . It also has many benefits in doing so . Some of the more common liberal arts majors include communications, English, foreign language, history, philosophy, political science, mathematics, psychology, economics and sociology. As a liberal arts student, youâ€™ll take courses in the arts, humanities (the study of the human condition), social sciences, mathematics and natural sciences. Youâ€™ll also learn a variety of skills, such as critical thinking, verbal and written communication, and problem-solving, which will help you in the workplace. Liberal arts education is typically broad-based and exposes students to science, mathematics, social sciences, and humanities. This broad knowledge of the wider world will prepare you to deal with complexity, diversity, and change. A liberal arts education will also help you develop a strong sense of social responsibility as well as strong and transferable intellectual and practical skills, such as communication, analytical, and problem-solving abilities, and a demonstrated ability to apply knowledge and skills in real-world settings.""""",,,,,,,

Not only can it get you to a High paying job, but going it is said to help with people gaining knowledge and skills for different fields.
 
 Firstly If we take a look at progression between progression between Liberal arts education and Technical education The ""Liberal Arts Education"" states that "" A major 2015 Hart Research Survey found 81 percent of employers called for improvement in ""knowledge and skills that apply to a range of fields or positions."" My reason for putting this piece is because the comparison was that tech skills have a higher pay off but, as we can see liberal arts progressed in progression for skills and they can be used in different fields. Also the Technical education doesn't state the rate at what kids progression peaked at.
 
 Secondly the liberal arts education talks about ones with enough skills or education in a field can have nice possibilities/benefits for a career or anything else. For this I can relate and think of a time where knowing something more that applied to my values or just knowing something more than someone who didn't put that much effort in really shows in the end result. Knowing the full thing and having a lot of skills can benefit in the long run as well, and can help you make a commitment to pursue something you want.
 
 Thirdly the ""Technical Education"" states ""what's the point of having a well-paying job if it makes you miserable"" to this statement I have a rebuttal myself. As the ""Liberal Arts Education"" states that the skills that Liberal arts education provides help with different fields and with this in mind, is it not possible to align yourself with something that goes with the career that you want, or with the skills that you have from Liberal Arts?
 
 In Conclusion I believe that The ""Technical Education"" piece puts down the ""Liberal Arts Education"" a little too much due to saying it can't help in the long run, but with the skills that Liberal Education does provide it's possible to use these in other things that you want to pursue in not just your Career. Also it has been seen as stated in the Liberal Piece that it's continuing to grow and that the skills are paying off in the long run and if they don't they can be used in other fields the Students decide to go that meets their needs.

 Firstly We have the the income difference. In the Article, ""Kelly Ochs Rosinger"" states ""Low-income and minority students, for instance, often don't have the same access to advanced high school courses"". This just ends up showing how problems aren't even solved on base form and there's still answer to be sought out.
 
 Secondly, we have the opportunities that are given to the kids/young Adults for the preparation of the SAT and ACT. Kelly states ""...Low income and underrepresented minority students tend to score lower on average than their peers"". she also states how students may not know how to take the test and how they'll only be able to take it once due to circumstances.
 
 Thirdly price dis[-advantage. Kelly ends up talking about how price can b a factor for students to walk away from the situation. Evidence from the text is "" Although institutions substantially discount tuition for students with financial need, students are often not aware of discounts until after they apply and receive a financial aid offer.""

Both of the ways are beneficial to college students now here's why........
 
 When most people go to college they don't really think about 10-20 years in the future. After about 5 years your job is going to start to get repetitious. After you start doing the same thing everyday you're going to ask yourself ""do i get paid enough to do this"" and you are going to start to think a lot about ""did i really go to college for 4-8 years just to do this or get paid that"" when in reality you didn't have to. According to the text "" In Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degree â€” and an average annual wage that is about half that of an associateâ€™s graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenance."" Why go to college or that long when you can go for 1-2 years and make more money than a person who wastes their life away for 4-8 years just to make less? While that person is in college for 4-8 years you already have your job, your own place, and you are financially stable and you don't have to live with your parents. Living in America is hard but make it easier with you having money in your pocket. Money doesn't buy happinessbut it buys the things that makes you happy. So why not having everything you want by the age of 25 and not getting out of college or just freshly 2 years out of college still looking for a job that you didn't go to college for? Unless yo absolutely love the job you're going to college for, why go to college for more than 4 years to make less money?
 
 Yes, that's right you can make more money with just having 2 years of college under your belt than a person that has 4 or more. It's unbelievable right? According to the article ""One pattern is evident even in this small set of examples â€” there are many associate degree programs, especially those that teach technical skills, that have a very high payoff."" Schnieder, Debate: Liberal Arts Education or Technical Education?. Nobody after highschool really wants to go to do school for 4 more years. So why do they do it you may ask? Most people feels like its a requirement to have 4 or more years under your belt to get a well'paying job when its really not. So consider yourself lucky that you know this because most people don't. The job is easier to get, less time spent doing school work, pays more; everything just seems to add up to a job in a technical field job in my eyes what about yours?
 
 Now don't get me wrong a job in the technical field do sound like a match made in heaven but also it might make you miserable and so will a job in liberal arts. After abut 15 years in any job it takes a lot away from you an may do damage to your body so when going to college please look at every perspective of the job and not just how much money you make or just because it looks easy. Take a step back and look 10-20 years in the future and think about where that job will have you, what it will do to your body, the negative effects for working there, etc. When deciding what you do after college is a serious decision so don't what to think about it to late, do it before you go to college and somewhat during so that you're not stuck after college. Always know what you're doing and think about your future every now and then and see if what you're doing today is going to help you get where you want to get in the future.

It makes certain schools want to choose someone who submitted their score because it makes them seem ""smart"" if they submit their school which in all reality intelligence can't be measured on paper. 
 
 Some may say the test-opt program helps kids take away something negative on their application if they did bad on their act. Which is true and a great point to make but which would you rather take a kid that submitted their act score with a bad score or one that didn't submit their score at all? Hard decision right? Now add in someone who did good on their act. In logical terms a person would take the good act score, so that means 1/3 children is getting accepted to a college. We want an higher acceptance rate right? 
 
 It's time for colleges to stop being act/sat biased with college applications and to start to fully look over the application and to take even viewing the act off the app because not many do good with the act/sat. Making colleges test-opt leaned more towards the bad then good. We need to find another way to help kids get into college without having barriers.

I would have to lean more towards liberal arts. I think liberal arts will take you further in a majority of careers that you might want to pursue. You use these on a daily basis so they come easy to you already. If you pair these arts with a career that you enjoy and want to pursue then you will absolutely make it to where you want to be. I do see how some people would think that technical skills would be better to pursue though.
 I think liberal arts will take you further in a majority of careers you might choose to pursue because of what your liberal arts are. In the text it says that ""a liberal arts foundation - which by definition embraces strong writing skills, scientific reasoning, foreign language, analytical reasoning and mathematics."" These are things you will use everyday of your life so they naturally come to you already. If you enhance these skills and pursue a career in it then you will excel.
 These skills are easily parable with many different careers. If you can pair them with a career that you enjoy then you can make it to high places in that career as long as you put in the work to do so. These skills can take you really far but you have to work hard to get to where you want to be. 
 I can see where people might think that pursuing technical skills would be a better idea and for some people it might be but i say overall liberal arts is better.You can apply liberal arts to just about everything in this world and you cant say the same about technical skills. Some careers with technical skills might have a higher payoff but knowing your liberal arts and enhancing them will help you with your career as well as your everyday life.
 In conclusion, I personally think that college stufents should pursue careers focused on liberal arts to better themselves for life in general not just their careers.

Making colleges test optional means that applicants don't have to take certain tests to enroll into a college. That's a good idea in theory but in reality its only helping the college and not the applicants. When test-optional policies got implemented it really helped higher scoring students more than it did lower scoring students. Test-optional admission policies is a great way to try to get students who don't normally get noticed into selective colleges if it was to work, but it doesn't.
 
 The colleges are gaining more from being test-optional than students are for them being test-optional. Since certain colleges are test-optional that means they are getting in more applications. When they get in more applications they have to be more selective. This makes it seem like they are a better college than they actually are. That can bring in more intellectual students. This doesn't help students as much either. Even though certain colleges are test-optional, they are going to look more at student who still have taken the tests to show their knowledge.
 
 With colleges going test-optional, it really helps the students that scored higher on those tests regardless. These colleges are getting more applications in from students that aren't taking these tests. So the students that do take the tests stand out more and it proves their knowledge and learning capability's more than someone who didn't take the tests. 
 
 Test-optional policies are a great idea at first glance but once you dive down into understanding what really is happening then you will understand that it doesn't work as well as planned. At first glance you see that students have a chance to get noticed without having to take certain tests. This could be good because not all students are good test takers but they are still really smart and have good learning capability's. But that's only if it works perfectly, unfortunately nothing in this world is perfect so this test-optional policy wont work as planned. 
 
 In conclusion, test optional policy's are great, on paper. When it comes to real world it doesn't work as planned. This is more beneficial to the colleges than it is to the students. The students don't gain much from it. The colleges gain higher selectiveness giving the illusion that they are a better college than they really are. The students only get a smaller chance at getting accepted into the college than they would of already.

In articles like ""If you thought colleges making the SAT optional would level the playing field,think again"" by Kelly Ochs Rosinger she points out how she,Andrew Belaseo and Jim Heam found no increase in diversity in test-optional colleges.One of the many reasons colleges are switching.
 
 This new policy is in fact making selective colleges appear more selective, as said by Rosinger. Going test-optional increases the amount of applications meaning that colleges reject more people as they need to be more selective,This increase in selectivity means that those who applied and are of low-income households may be less likely to get a good score and not submit theirs,while higher-income students who had more opportunity to get help and get a higher score would submit theirs making the college look better.This may make a bias against those who do not submit their score.
 
 Minorities on average score lower than their counterparts on standardized test, so test-optional policies may help in that area. But that's like putting a band-aid on a open wound. Minorities have many other things to consider when choosing a college as they may be working to support their families and may need to go to a college close to home or their jobs. Many also don't know about financial aid until after they applied.
 
 The new research shows that test-optional policies are only the first step in truly increasing diversity. The most important is to expand the range of financial aid colleges give out. Colleges should be actively looking out in low income neighborhoods for high-achieving students that may have not applied and offer them any type of help they need.""""",,,,,,,

The goal that was sought after wasn't achieved and in fact created some conflicts. The goal was to increase diversity in colleges by making the SAT an optional part of the admissions process. It was a good plan but just didn't work and here's why.
 Colleges wanted to increase diversity within their schools but instead all they did was make colleges even more selective than they already were. This is because there were more applicants which means more rejections. Lower income students didn't have the same access to things that other financially supported students would have while in high school. Which meant that lower income students were still getting rejected because of other things that they didn't have on their applications. In the text it states ""We found no changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after the colleges went test-optional.

That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. Thatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections.

Low-income and minority students, for instance, often donâ€™t have the same access to advanced high school courses. They also have less access to high school counselors to assist with college essays, recommendations, and other materials that go into an application.'' 
 Another reason is that not everyone will submit their SAT scores anymore. Students will get bad scores and keep them to themselves and not try again to do better. This lead to a 25 point increase in the reported SAT scores. Which means higher average scores will be sent to the government. In the text it states '' We also found a 25-point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower-scoring students keep their scores to themselves. This results in higher average scores being reported to the federal government and magazines that publish college rankings.
 Lastly colleges are using the test-optional option for the wrong reasons.

 I think that college students should pursue a major focused on technical skills. I chose this because that's going to be one of the main things that we will really need in our lifetime. Also another reason is because in the text technical education it says that people who teach technical skill get paid more. One of the times that it points this out is where it says ""one of the stateâ€™s most common majors, makes around $40,000 a year less than a bachelorâ€™s graduate in computer or electrical engineering."" here it proves that it can also be helpful to focus on technical more than arts education.
 
 Some people may wonder if this is what they want or if they would'nt enjoy doing this but it brings out how they found out there are no differences in satisfaction levels of associate's graduates compared to those with a bachelor's graduate.
 
 For me choosing technical skills is better than liberal arts because you get more money and i think that might be one of the most important things in life and if you able to learn more and have a job you will enjoy then I think this would be the better choice
 
 the last reason I think this is better than liberal arts is because if you don't think your going to want to do something dealing with art in your future then there will be no point of taking this but most work forces deal with something technical so either way most likely if you work a job it will be dealing with a technical skill(s) so that's why I think that it is more important to take technical skills when you go to college""""",,,,,,,

 technical education is really good for tools with techniques. i feel that if we all learn some it can really change things a lot. i know this because in the text of ""liberal arts education or technical education it states ""All those who are thinking about making this commitment of time and money have a right to know if their selected pathway ends in the life they envision both financially and emotionally. At a minimum, information about outcomes needs to be in front of all students as they consider one of the most consequential decisions of their lives.""
 
 doing technical education majors can also save you a lot of time and you can make a lot of money. you don't need a higher major to succeed in life or to have bigger pay. i know this because in the text it states "" In Tennessee, a graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology, one of the stateâ€™s most common majors, makes around $40,000 a year less than a bachelorâ€™s graduate in computer or electrical engineering."" also it states ""In Colorado, a student from the Community College of Aurora with a certificate in fire protection, which takes less than one year to complete, can expect to earn $865,000 more over his or her work life compared with a high school graduate.""

 Liberal arts has many different skills. All of the skills I have listed in the first paragraph like writing skills or foreign language can be very important later in life. Having all these different skills may help you get a job later in life or it may help you in the real world as well. Think about it, if your were the boss hiring people, would you hire someone with all these skills or someone without them? Let me tell you more about why liberal arts education is better than technical skills.
 You may make better money if you learn technical skills but you may not like the job. In the technical skills article it says ""But what's the point of having of having a well-paying job if the work makes you miserable?"" Money is a good thing but working somewhere you like and not dread it everyday is even better in my opinion. Your still getting money and your doing something enjoy versus making more money but hate going to work.
 In conclusion liberal arts is better than technical skills. You will learn a lot more skills if you learn liberal arts. Studying liberal arts may not make you as much money as studying technical skills most people enjoy their jobs.

The price for some of the colleges that went test optional are to expensive and the distance of the college from their homes. Let me tell you more about why test optional did more harm than good.
 You would think if a college went test optional there would be a more expanding racial diversity and economics. That's not the case. The article says ""Despite the milestone, research that colleagues and I conducted shows that instead of expanding economic and racial diversity at American colleges, test optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges more selective.""The article also says ""Test optional policies led to increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective."" Even though colleges went test optional, students have almost the same chance of getting in as if they would have to take the test.
 The price is another big thing. If the college makes you take a test to get in then that college is going to a so called ""smarter college."" Usually smarter colleges are more expensive so therefor a lot of kids cannot afford to go there. The article says ""Sticker price, for instance, may defer students from applying."" Now schools do give tuition to kids in financial need but not many students know that so they do not apply.
 That brings me to my last point, distance. Some kids may love a college but it is far away. They may not like being so far from home and leaving their families. The article says ""Distance may also prevent students from applying or attending, particularly those who work to support families."" Some kids don't have it like others. Some kids have to help with bills and food so the need to stay close to home while they get an education.
 That is why test optional college admission policies do more harm than good. Even though the colleges are test optional they are still very selective. Also the pricing and distance of a your dream college may to expensive or too far. """"",,,,,,,

A broad range of future careers will also be more available for you. Liberal arts education makes people happier and their life more enjoyable. It helps students become more well rounded and teaches them many skills like strong writing skills, scientific reasoning, foreign language, analytical reasoning and mathematics. Most employers would recommend liberal arts education ro prepare them for success. 
  
  Liberal arts education teaches broadly useful skills, it makes people more valuable to employers and valuable in the job market. I know this because in the article it says â€œ 2015 Hart Research Survey found 81 percent of employers called for improvement in â€œknowledge and skills that apply to a range of fields or positions.â€ Having this education can help you be able to do any job and get hired. Those who can write and speak effectively and those with enough background in economics to understand market forces are going to do a lot better than those without such skills. 
 
  Liberal arts lets you have more choices to pick depending on your interest. Most of the time students still don't know what career they want to pursue so taking multiple classes can help you find a career that interests you most. Which helps guide you and find something you will actually want to do and enjoy. Students who put some training ahead of the liberal learning that educates for career, community, and citizenship make a bad bargain with the future. It is, in reality, eminently possible to have it all, including all the benefits of a career and a life shaped by values.
 
  
  While students have every right to pursue their passions, they should also have information like with Technical Education you have to come up with one major and stick with that unlike liberal education because you can explore many types of majors.
 
  In conclusion, a liberal education is the best preparation and what's going to help you be more successful and have many job choices because they teach you broadly useful skills, it makes people more valuable.

It gives students who did well on tests the chance to submit their test scores and be rewarded. Low-income and underrepresented students face a number of other hurdles that may deter them from applying to a selective college. Test-optional admissions policies were implemented to help low-income and underrepresented students, but rather then helping people see it as another barrier of how it affects low income students.
  One reason test optional college admissions policies do more good than harm is standardized tests help discover the talented and most successful students. According to the text, ""If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again"" it says, ""standardized tests provide one way for selective colleges to identify talented students who might have gone unnoticed in the admissions process. Critics note that research, however, shows standardized test scores do little above and beyond GPA to predict college success."" This quote supports why test optional does more good than harm by discovering the ones who score well and actually go to college to be successful and not just drop out and give up.
  Another reason test optional college admissions policies do more good than harm is it was meant to help others that have been overlooked. The standardized test was meant to expand access to different groups of people. In the text, ""If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again"" it states that ""The hope was that it would expand access to the nationâ€™s most selective institutions to groups that had historically been shut out."" This supports how it was never meant to harm or add another barrier to why people don't apply.
  Lastly, test optional college admissions policies do more good than harm because it led to an increase in the number of applications overall. According to the text, ""If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again"" it also says, ""More applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective. That appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing. This all creates a perverse incentive for colleges to go test-optional that has nothing to do with expanding access for students from low-income families."" This piece of text supports how this test isn't more harmful than good for low income students.
 Although, people might say low-income or minority students may not know to take the SAT or ACT or how to prepare for it, might be deterred by the cost of the exam, or take it only once. However, While test-optional admissions were designed, in part, to draw more applications from low-income and underrepresented students, there are many other reasons why these students may not apply. Things like pricing and distance are the biggest factors. 
  In conclusion, test-optional policies may or may not be helpful. But one thing for sure is the test- optional policies aren't harming others from applying to colleges. The reasons above support my claim of why test optional college admissions do more good than harm. Colleges should reconsider, but not eliminate, test-optional policies, as well as take additional measures to bring in low-income students.

Recently many colleges have been giving applicants the option to submit a test optional application. This sounds great but is actually making things a lot more complicated than people thought.

The article says, ""Test optional policies led to an increase in the number of applicants overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective."" So, since colleges are going test optional, far more students are applying, which means far more applications have to be rejected. This means that, statistically, colleges will look more selective and in turn move up in the ranking system. This will give colleges another incentive to go test optional that has nothing to do with ""expanding access for students from low-income families."" as the article says.

 Although colleges offering a test optional admissions option started with good intentions, it didn't stay that way. After a few colleges went test optional, they realized they had to become more selective which made them ranked higher, more colleges began to want to go test optional too, but not for the reason that it was originally intended. They also realized that since the only test scores that were being submitted were high scores, their schools average test score was getting higher which gave colleges yet another incentive to go test optional that had nothing to do with students coming from low income families.

Both have promising ideals but I firmly believe technical skills is definitely the way to go. 
 
 You might ask why I chooses technical skills over a college education. One reason is that it pays well. If you are looking to get into a carer field right after high school that pays a decent wage trade school is the right path for you. According to the article ""Liberal arts education or Technical Education"" written by Mark Schneider, Cheryl Oldham, and Brandon Busteed they say that as a high school graduate you can earn up to $865,000 in your life time of work if you have a certificate in fire protection in only one year of after high school schooling. You don't to spend 4 years working towards a degree and gaining debt when you could spend 1 more year and be work while you do it. 
 
 Another reason I would add is that it doesn't take as much schooling to get your certification in a technical skill. At most it would take two years to get certified and then to become a ""master"" it is based off of on the job experiences. As stated in the article ""Liberal arts Education or Technical Education"" the authors go on to say that there is no difference between a bachelors degree and an associates degree when it comes to job satisfaction. Knowing this I would without a doubt choose technical skill over liberal arts. 
 
 Now I know what you're gonna say, ""it still takes time to become a master technician so why wouldn't i just got to school"". You are 100% correct it takes time just like everything in life does, but the payoff for technical school is way better because you don't compile as much if any debt, and in most cases the you're making more money. But I can still see where you are coming from when you say these things. 
 
 One last reason I would give as to why technical skills are better is because is some trades, it is a dying art. What this essentially means is that you would always have job security, unlike with a degree in liberal arts you wouldn't. If you get fired you're fired there is no "" ohhhh I'll just call my union rep"" you're finding your own job.
 
 With all this being said it is ultimately your decision to decide whats best for and how things turn out is up to you. Don't get me wrong a Liberal Arts Education is still important and we need those jobs too, but technical education is more promising than a Liberal arts degree. """"",,,,,,,

The college student should choose whatever degree will lead them in the way that they want.
 
 There are a lot of students who want to receive technical degrees. These have lots of pros to them, one of which is the length of a technical degree. A technical degree can get you an associate degree in 2 years. The article states, ""there are many associate degree programs, especially those that teach technical skills, that have a very high payoff"". This shows that you can make a decent living for half the time of a bachelor's degree. The downside to a technical degree is enjoyment. The Gallup poll says that there is no difference in enjoyment, and that is because the kids with technical degrees are the ones that want a technical degree. If we force people who don't enjoy that line of work to get technical degrees, the dissatisfaction number will rise.
 
 A liberal arts degree is typically a 4 year degree. The reason that it is a longer degree is because you take in more information.

The negatives to a liberal arts degree is the success rate. The earnings of liberal arts majors is averaged out by graduates with a liberal arts degree. A lot of liberal arts fields are competitive, so the earnings are higher for people that make it. However, not nearly as many people succeed as they do fail, so the failure numbers bring the average down.
 
 So as I stated earlier, the choice is not up to a 3rd party as to what the best degree path is. The choice is the students. Our world would be full of engineers or plumbers if a technical degree was better, and full of musicians and journalists if a liberal arts degree was better. It all depends on one word. Passion. If a student has a passion, they should follow it. Whenever someone is passionate about something, they work as hard as they can to make it a success. We cannot stop someone from trying. A degree is pursued in what someone is passionate about, not whatever may seem like the best choice. """"",,,,,,,

By adding this they thought it would help make the schools more diverse and it would help the minorities. test-optional college admissions is doing more harm then good because it makes the college more selective because of the more applications its receiving, by not putting your test scores it tends to get you not recognized.
 Optional test scores can make the college more selective. As a senior in high school seeing that a school is test score optional it might make you want to apply. Well you and hundreds of more students who probably wouldn't apply if it wasn't score optional. A study by Kelly Ochs Rosinger shows that while having a test optional school the number in applications increases significantly.
 Many may say having test scores as a option gives the students more of a chance because if they scored low the school wouldn't see. While this may be somewhat true Students who don't put their test score have less chances of being recognized. If a student scores high they would put their test score so they have more of a chance to get in. Imagine you have 10 good test scores versus 10 no scores, you are more likely to take the 10 good scores so that it can boost you're colleges ranking.

One would think that this is a great option for students. Test-optional policies are supposed to be an equalizer and open up new opportunities to low-income students and minorities. But they have not done that. Instead, test-optional policies do more harm than good by drifting away from the central idea of that policy and have not increased diversity in the way they are supposed to.
 
 The purpose of the test-optional movement was to prevent hardworking low income and minority students from being denied just because of their test scores. Most selective colleges tend to favor students from the top 1 percent of family income. But according to the article ""If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again,"" by Kelly Rosinger, ""test-optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selective...we found no increase in diversity at test-optional colleges."" Test-optional policies are naturally appealing to several students, so colleges receive more applications. With an increase in applicants, naturally, there are more rejections. This makes colleges look selective, giving them higher college ratings. So, test-optional colleges are primarily looking out for their own interests, gravitating away from the central idea of making SAT scores optional. It has nothing to do with equalizing the students.
 
 Some may reason that the idea behind test-policies is noble. They are meant to give students equal opportunities by making it easier for students to get into colleges. Some kids are not great at taking tests and some do not have the resources that would help them to get a high score. In the article, Rosinger reports that highly selective colleges tend to have â€œmore students on average come from the top 1 percent in terms of family income than from the bottom 60 percent.â€ But it has not solved or improved this problem. Why? Because other factors cause colleges to favor the higher 1 percent. Once colleges stop looking at test grades, they are going to scrutinize applications even more. This leads to low-income and minority students being left out. As the article says, â€œLow income and minority students often donâ€™t have the same access to advanced high school courses. They also have less access to high school counselors to assist with college essays, recommendations, and other materials that go into an application.â€ Higher-income students tend to have these supports, so they can make their application more appealing. Colleges are now more likely to favor those applicants, leading back to the central problem of adding more minorities and low-income students to their institutions. 
 
 Although it is a good idea; the idea of trying to make the playing field more even for students, it is not working. Test-optional policies benefit the colleges themselves instead of the students. They have drifted away from the purpose of these policies. They also do not make applications easier for low-income and minority students. If anything, it puts them at a disadvantage. Kids from high-income families are still being favored. The only way these policies could be beneficial is if they widened out and offered access to programs that make applications easier for disadvantaged students. So many students are being overlooked because of their situation in life and that is not fair. Test-optional colleges need to focus on what helps those students best.

However, as colleges have adopted the test-optional policy to help students, it doesn't seem to fully do its job. Test-optional college admissions policies do more harm than good.
 
 Diversity is something that has not been positively effected by test-optional policies. If anything, there has been negative change. The article states, ""instead of expanding economic and racial diversity at American colleges, test-optional policies have actually served to make colleges more selective, at least on paper."" This means that the policies have not encouraged more diversity, but instead encourage more selectivity within the system.
 
 Colleges are actually more likely to accept applications to make themselves look good rather than giving everyone a chance. The article states, ""We also found a 25 point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increase may be driven by higher scoring students being more likely to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower scoring students keep their scores to themselves."" This discourages lower scoring students from submitting their scores as they feel like they won't make it in.
 
 Test-Optional policies also do not get rid of other barriers. The article says, ""While efforts to go test-optional are well intentioned, other factors in college applications may favor economic or racial privilege. Grades, course selection, recommendations, essays, and extracurricular activities possibly favor higher-income students who often have greater support navigating the college administration process. Low-income and minority students, for instance, often don't have the same access to advanced high school courses."" This shows that colleges are willing to favor students who show clear advantages over other students, even if it isn't the right thing to do.
 
 Test-optional policies do more harm than good. Whether it has no change on diversity, allowing colleges to just accept more applications to bump up their numbers, or favoring more privileged students, test-optional policies have not shown to completely help all students. It still allows colleges to play favorites and does not get rid of other barriers. Lower scoring students aren't more likely to apply to colleges because of test-optional policies.

More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective. That appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing""(Rosinger). This argument is invalid because it has nothing to do with the low income families instead its only benefiting the colleges.

Presenting that test optional admission is harming the lower income families and should be changed.
 In conclusion, test optional admissions is a good idea, but in reality it is harmful for low income families because of no progress in diversity in colleges and damage of lower income families.

Test optional policies make colleges more selective. Test optional colleges show no increase in diversity. Test optional policies make applying more competitive.
  First, test optional policies make colleges more selective. With an increase in applications, colleges have to reject more applications. According to the article ""If You Thought Colleges Making SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again"", test-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. Thatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective. That appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing. This all creates a perverse incentive for colleges to go test-optional that has nothing to do with expanding access for students from low-income families."" This evidence shows that colleges being more selective doesn't really benefit low income families or under represented students at all.
  In addition, test optional policies show no increase in diversity. The goal for test optional policies was to give low income and underrepresented students a chance to get accepted into colleges but that wasn't the outcome. According to the article ""If You Thought Colleges Making SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again"", ""For our research, my colleagues Andrew Belasco and Jim Hearn did a before-and-after comparison of applications, enrollment, and SAT scores among low-income and underrepresented minority students at 180 liberal arts colleges. Of those 180 colleges, 32 had adopted a test-optional policy.
 We found no changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after the colleges went test-optional. ""At highly selective colleges, more students on average come from the top 1 percent in terms of family income than from the bottom 60 percent, recent research shows."" This evidence shows that the original goal for the test optional policy was not met because it did the complete opposite by showing no increase in diversity of low income students.
  Lastly, test optional policies make applying more competitive. Many students may end up submitting more things in their applications to increase their chance of getting accepted. In the article ""If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again"", ""We also found a 25-point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower-scoring students keep their scores to themselves. This results in higher average scores being reported to the federal government and magazines that publish college rankings. Thus, it appears as though by increasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieve."" This evidence shows that applications being more competitive hurts the chances of low income and underrepresented students chance of getting accepted into college since most don't report their SAT scores.
  On the other hand, some believe that the test optional policy doesn't do any harm because it gives low income students a chance to apply. However, low income and underrepresented students have many other barriers that prevent them from applying. Barrier such as financial aid, racial privilege, and distance 
  In conclusion, test optional policies do more harm than good. Test optional policies make colleges more selective. Test optional policies show no increase in diversity. Lastly, test optional policies make applying to college more competitive. Some may believe that test optional policies do more good by giving low income and underrepresented students a chance to apply but there are still other barriers that come into play.

 By. Ahmaree Webster
 
  When students see the words â€œtest optionalâ€ on a college application they immediately think that this is a good thing. Colleges will use this as a way to get more students to apply for their schools. The more students who think skipping out on an ACT or a SAT is better for them are the ones who end up hurt in the end. Test-Optional policies are more harmful to your application then helpful. Taking that ACT or SAT can be what makes your application stand out.
  One term that is used often is â€œalways read the fine printâ€. On college applications there is no fine print so what do you read? Well, when most students apply for colleges they tend to look at the more bolded words, things that stick out. Terms such as no application fee, no essay requirement, test optional, and even early decision. Colleges depend on this. They hope that you see these and you apply. Kelly Ochs Rosinger, a writer for The Conversation wrote â€œ.......more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective. That appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing.â€. Colleges want you at their school yes, but they get credit from your application alone so why not make it good.
  Taking the ACT or SAT is challenging because no matter what your score is you still want it to be higher. Whether your score is a 28 or a 14 it should still be submitted with your college applications because it makes your application stand out. â€œCritics note that research, however, shows standardized test scores do little above and beyond GPA to predict college success.â€ This statement said by Kelly Ochs Rosinger, explains that score does not define knowledge. Standardized tests are more challenging to assure success for college students. If students used the test optional approach, colleges list them lower than students who sent in test scores, grades, and accomplishments. Submitting that test score can potentially push any student to the top of that list.
  Now, some may say that students from low income families can not afford these tests, and the test- optional is better for them. Standardized tests are a requirement for eleventh grade students. Schools give students this test to help them get into colleges and to test what they know. Yes, some low income students may miss opportunities if they attend schools with less money who can not fund this test. But, these are also the students who are given fee-waiver. Standardized tests are free for any low income student on fee-waiver. Everyone gets a chance to take the test, submitting their scores however, is a choice.
  When submitting a college application, the choice of submitting a test score is a choice. Unfortunately, it is not a very fortunate one. The test optional policy on college applications is more harmful than helpful. Colleges trick students into thinking â€œtest-optionalâ€ is a positive thing while in reality it is not. Colleges only want your application so they will do anything to receive it. Taking that ACT or SAT test can better your applications no matter the score. The term â€œtest-optionalâ€ on an application is the same as seeing a dead animal in the road. Skipping over it is always the best option, in both situations.

14521751,10/9/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,WK5M8Q,Ahnaka Basham,NULL,""" College students should pursue a major focused on liberal arts education. In your lifetime you might want to rethink your decision of career. With a liberal arts background that can be possible and very easy to do since it is a less narrow field as Mark Schneider said. Also in society today, culture is very involved in a lot of things we do, as the text says ""And the imperative of understanding other cultures and nations has never been as urgent"". With a liberal arts background that can be covered.
  If you were to pursue a technical skills background it does not open you up to a lot of possibilities. What happens if you hate your career in a few years? You would either be forced to work a job in a field you hate the rest of you life or you would have to go to school for another 4 more years spending more money and more time because you don't have the experience you want. If you had a liberal arts background you could have changed your career successfully without anymore school because this major teaches skills and training in several different categories. â€œknowledge and skills that apply to a range of fields or positions.â€Â 
  In studies it shows that students who have masters in liberal arts have lower median earnings and over time make much less than students with degrees in technical skills. While in most cases this is true, they still make a good amount and are actually happy doing it. Not everything is completely about how much more can I make doing what. Sometimes it really just matters how happy your are doing it. ""In Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degree""
  Although, a major focused on technical skills, in the long run, pays double compared to a liberal arts education. and an average annual wage that is about half that of an associateâ€™s graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenance. ""In Tennessee, a graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology, one of the stateâ€™s most common majors, makes around $40,000 a year less than a bachelorâ€™s graduate in computer or electrical engineering."" Which to a young and nieve college student, would look great, more money is better right? But what they fail to realize is the constraints this major would put on them when trying to be flexible in the future.
  In conclusion, college students should pursue a major focused in liberal arts education because it will make them happy in the long run, allow them the flexibility to change careers if desired, and give them the experience to pursue a huge list of options of what type of job they want,

 When applying for college there are numerous steps and requirements along with it. Kids are pushed to always keep up their grades, behavior, and test scores. With colleges seeing how much of a struggle it has become, they are starting to make testing optional. Test-optional college admissions do more good than harm by relieving stress off students shoulders, decreasing the time consumed on looking through test scores for college, and offering those who are not good test takers an option to succeed.
 When beginning your high school career you are already thinking about college. Every year you are trying to do your very best and keep up with every little thing in order to not make any mistakes. When it finally comes time to apply you basically have to gather up everything you can remember, including test scores and even taking more tests. With colleges making the testing process optional, it makes the students' life so much easier. Just the littlest things taken off of their mind it makes applying less of a stressful task.
 While all of the thousands of applications are flying to the colleges of choice,it would be hard to imagine that the readers of said applications are not overwhelmed each year. Going through each file and learning about thousands of different children just to give them a yes or no. Relieving them of having to go through each test would make the process ten times easier, faster, and more efficient. When tests become optional it makes their job quicker and applicants receive their response quicker as well.
   With today's students, there are more than a handful that struggle with test taking. It is not their fault or their instructors of their previous years, it is just how some kids operate. They could be very bright, intelligent and pass everything else they are given to them, but when it comes to tests they struggle and flunk out. Many kids do not even get to finish school because it is such a challenge for them. With making testing optional it gives those kids chances to be admitted into college, maybe even the one of their dreams, and actually make something of their life and out of their natural intelligence. Giving them the opportunity, instead of throwing them out. 
 On the other hand, there is a view that making tests optional decreases the chances of students from low-income backgrounds of making it to college. Arguing that the tests are the only way for students of that background to be recognized. While even though that could play a role in that, they are still optional meaning the kids can still take the tests and shine through, or even if the test is not taken, if their academic life remains prosperous that will be a huge standout for colleges.
 In conclusion colleges and universities becoming test-optional causes way more good than harm, it relieves the stress off every applicants shoulders, allows the colleges process to become easier and quicker, and even provides kids who struggle to take tests the option to succeed.

The more skills you push yourself to learn the more impressive you are to employers. the way in which you go about it is less important. For instance, its clear that in two separate studies both liberal arts and technical skills were positively affected.
 
 Personally, i would focus on technical skills but this is solely due to the fact that I have more knowledge on these skills.

 As students you all spend hours and multiple days in school studying and preparing for the SAT or ACT, depending on your location. This is time for you to learn tips for how to get as high of a score as possible on a test basically testing how well you remember the past or your ability to guess. While there are people who score high it is simply rare. This test does not account for your ability to learn, how well you have done in school, or the things you have achieved. If you do not test well this test will show. If you missed breakfast before this test or maybe ate too much this test will show it. If your mind wanders for a moment too long this test will provide a visible test score that accounts for that misplacement of thought. 
 That being said with all the other potential ways to show a college your academic worth it is simply uncalled for to require these scores especially since many teens in high school feel ashamed because they didn't score well. While the ability to submit these rest in the few who scored well. The benefits of test optional colleges are abundant. One of those reasons being that more people will have the ability to be accepted simply because of the work they put in during high school. Although this change in academic requirements does provide a better demographic for the colleges choosing to do so as explained in this text, â€œThus, it appears as though by increasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieveâ€ (Rosinger 1). It does still benefit people tremendously by providing higher ranking schools on their job applications after college.
 The excess stress put on high school students to perform well on these tests are not worth it when there are plenty of schools that would allow students to enroll without providing the test scores. Therefore I say this idea puts more people's minds at ease with less things to worry about. This will help students who can't afford tutors and multiple tests. Let's put an end to these requirements on colleges who don't need this type of competition.

They could pursue their dreams in any majors that involve the Liberal arts, which many studies have proven that it oftentimes leads to lower-paying jobs. Or, students could focus on a major on technical skills which will lead them to higher-paying jobs. Our main goal in life as people is to live comfortably. To have a stable paying job that will keep our families fed, clothed, and warm. But many people also want to strive for the really nice and expensive cars or the 5 story mansion with 10 bedrooms and 8 bathrooms. While the arts may be your passion, receiving a major in technical skills will do you far better in the future than any major in liberal arts. 
 
 Studies in Texas have proven that students with a major in technical skills were getting paid way more than those with a major in music, fine arts, or English. â€œstudents who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degree â€” and an average annual wage that is about half that of an associateâ€™s graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenanceâ€ Another example of higher-paying jobs includes an example from a student that graduated from Community College of Aurora. In Colorado, a student from the Community College of Aurora with a certificate in fire protection, which takes less than one year to complete, can expect to earn $865,000 more over his or her work life compared with a high school graduate.â€
 
 Personally, when it comes to choosing the right major for me I always think about ending up hating my major/future job. But there are thousands of majors out there in the world that earn a lot of money and are bound to fit in with my personality. Even so, I can always have fun in my free time. â€œGallup has polled working graduates to gauge their job satisfaction and engagement in their communities. It has found that there are no differences in satisfaction levels of associateâ€™s graduates compared with bachelorâ€™s graduates.â€ 
 
 However, there are many studies that do demonstrate having an educational background in the liberal arts can help you significantly to get employed. â€œA major 2015 Hart Research Survey found 81 percent of employers called for improvement in knowledge and skills that apply to a range of fields or positions. Those who can write and speak effectively and those with enough background in economics to understand market forces are going to do a lot better than those without such skills.â€ Although studies do prove that students with a liberal arts major are likely to get more employed they do not specify what type of job those might be. Those jobs can include anything from working at the nearest McDonalds to working in the finest music company there is. There is no clear statement that indicates these people getting hired are receiving a high amount of pay or if their happy doing what they do. 
 
 College for me is one of the scariest topics anyone could talk about. Everyone has mixed opinions on rather if focusing on your heart will lead you to a better future, or if focusing on the job with the most pay would be the best for your future. This decision takes time and effort to really understand. There is no rush into deciding what it is you want to do. Take your time and truly think about what you want to do with your life, what you want to look like in the next 20 years.

Like it is said in the text ""Those who can write and speak effectively and those with enough background in economics to understand market forces are going to do a lot better than those without such skills."" Some students have a hard time with speaking fluently and sound very dumb in some ways. So learning how to do those efficiently can really pay off in the long run. It can help with future jobs and be used more often than technical skills. You could jump around more jobs with liberal arts.

Liberal arts is shaped around values and the way you want to see yourself in life. These things are very important. Values are very important in life but not only that it is how will you use this in the long term.

I believe students need to think long and hard about the career they want to have before they chose what they should study.
 I believe both majors are important in there own way. Each one has a different outcome for the student and does take a lot of time to think about. When choosing where to go to college and what to study it is very important to think about long term. How will this help me in the long run? """"",,,,,,,

When you worry more about your scores the more time you spend stressing yourself then studying and actually focusing on the most important part. With everything going on in the world right now the ACT is being waived with most colleges. When we find out the tests are being waived it makes us not want to do as good on our tests. So believe it or not test-optional admissions can do more harm than good. According to If you thought colleges making the SAT optional would level the playing field, think again. â€œInstead of expanding economic and racial diversity at American colleges, test-optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selective, at least on paper. But we found no increase in diversity at test-optional colleges.â€ ( Kelly Ochs Rosinger, page 1). The thought that goes through colleges minds when accepting and declining admissions, they think about how you looked all through high school some examples are grades wise, extracurricular activities and behavior. Colleges what to look good when it comes to letting students attend their school, they want the best. So if you do not have what they are looking for, good luck.
 When colleges turn towards the test optional application they tend to have to be more selective. Schools can only give admission to a certain number of students and when schools are test optional more students want to apply especially if they have low test scores. More applications means colleges have to really look at how the student looks on paper. â€œThat appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing. This all creates a perverse incentive for colleges to go test-optional that has nothing to do with expanding access for students from low-income families.â€ (Kelly Ochs Rosinger) Selectivity plays a major role in college admissions, colleges have to be careful of who they let into their schools. They do not want a bad reputation when it comes to who they let come to their school, some colleges are not as picky when it comes to admissions but it can be a lot more challenging to get into a certain college if you do not try your hardest to make yourself look good test wise and paper wise. Low income families do not always have the chance to attend college and a lot of the time they do not look the best test wise or paper wise, yet they try their hardest to be successful and do the best they can to get into college. When colleges have to be more selective they don't pick the lower test score student or the student who does not look the best, that student comes last after the students who will make the college look the best. So making admissions tests optional also can be a bad and good thing.

Well, I'm not a college expert but based off of what I've read I would choose to pursue a major in technical skills. This is because these jobs make a lot more money and they take less time in college. Many people may think the jobs are miserable but research proves this isn't true.
 In the country we live in money is major. You need money to survive but also you want a little extra to do fun things and be able to buy for your family and peers. Technical careers provide a lot more money than careers in music, fine arts or English. The text states,"" students who earned master's degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associates degree-- and an average annual wage that is about half that of an associate's graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenance."" Everybody wants to be able to have a good paying job and careers in the technical skills field defiantly have very high payoffs. 
 A major in technical skills will also mean less time and money in college. Depending on your career choice is how much time in college you will need but there are a lot of careers in this field that only require an associates degree. For example, in the passage it states,"" a student from the Community College of Aurora with a certificate in fire protection, which takes less than one year to complete, can expect to earn $865,000 more over his or her work life compared with a high school graduate."" Seeing that these careers could only take two years in college and still earning more than a job that takes ten years in college is pretty convincing to me.
 Some may think that the benefits of technical careers are too good to be true saying that the jobs are probably miserable. However, research has proven this statement is false. In the text it states,""Gallup has polled working graduates to gauge their job satisfaction and engagement in their communities. It has found that there are no differences in satisfaction levels of associate's graduates compared with bachelor's graduates."" Everyone's dream is to love their job while making a lot of money.
 If I was picking between a major focused on technical skills or liberal arts education I would choose technical skills. These careers make a lot more money and they don't require as much time in college. Plus, the job satisfaction is the same as others. Time to go get that associates degree.

Over the years more and more colleges have tried to make these tests optional in order to allow for more diversity in the colleges but this plan didnâ€™t work out how they had hoped it would. Test-optional college admission policies did the opposite of increasing diversity by making colleges more selective and caused an increase in the scores of those students who still took the SAT; although some may say these tests have nothing to do with diversity at all.
 Test-optional college admission policies caused there to be an increase in applications which resulted in colleges being even more selective. In the article, If You Thought Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again, it states,â€ Test-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. Thatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections.â€ These test-optional policies were guiding colleges in the opposite way of their goals regarding diversity. With more applications comes more rejections and makes the appearance of more selectivity which to some people makes a college better but this did not help with the low income families being able to get into these colleges. 
 Test-optional policies also caused a major increase in SAT scores that were submitted. In the article by Kelly Ochs Rosinger, it says,â€ Thus, it appears as though by increasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieve.â€ The test-optional policies made the higher-scoring students more likely to submit their scores while the lower-scoring students less likely to. This didnâ€™t help the lower income students who arenâ€™t able to afford to take these tests get into college. It only increased the competition and allowed for higher scores to be reported for college rankings. 
 The whole point of test-optional policies was to increase diversity in colleges but some people donâ€™t think these tests have anything to do with diversity at all. In the article it says,â€ Additionally, standardized test scores are strongly correlated with studentsâ€™ economic and racial background. In other words, low-income and underrepresented minority students tend to score lower on average than their peers.â€ It has been proven that these tests have a disadvantage for these low-income students. The text also states,â€Low-income or minority students may not know to take the SAT or ACT or how to prepare for it, might be deterred by the cost of the exam, or take it only once.â€ These tests cost money if students choose to re-take it to try and get a better score and some students canâ€™t afford to do this. Also depending on the high school, some students might not know how to sign up for these tests which is another disadvantage for them. These tests have a direct relationship with diversity in colleges.
 Diversity in colleges is a big problem because lower-income students should have the same opportunities and an equal playing field when it comes to trying to get into college. Unfortunately they donâ€™t because of the standardized tests. The goal for test-optional policies was to increase diversity in colleges however they went in the opposite direction by making colleges look more selective and increasing test scores.

The answer is Yes, College students should pursue a major focused on Technical skills rather than liberal arts education. Technical skill majors can provide great skills that can be used in many different jobs and careers. They also can help get you good paying jobs that aren't miserable.
 
  Careers that Involve technical skill based majors are higher paying careers than liberal arts. People with these degrees can make double that of a liberal arts education type bachelor's degree. Students who get degrees in such categories as liberal arts have â€œan average annual wage that is about half that of an associateâ€™s graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenance.â€ This shows that even with an associates degree they can make more which benefits you the most.
 
  You might say â€œwell these jobs must be miserable due to a higher payâ€ the answer, No. Most of the people who have these jobs have similar satisfaction to others who have liberal arts type major jobs. â€œGallup has polled working graduatesâ€ to see the difference between their â€œjob satisfaction and engagement in their communitiesâ€ and they found that there was â€œno differences in satisfaction levels of associateâ€™s graduates compared with bachelorâ€™s graduates.â€

15007825,1/14/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,WK5M8Q,Bailey Grimes,NULL,""" Test-optional college admissions policies are policies that make the SAT optional for admission into that college. This policy expects to be able to give greater access to more selective institutions to Low-income and minority students. But they do not accurately meet this goal. This Test-optional policy actually hurts low-income and minority students more than before. It makes people who took the test look better, Reasons for this policy that donâ€™t even correlate to minorities or low-income students, and other factors against them that decrease diversity in colleges.
 
 The SAT is now optional for admission at select colleges. This would make it seem to be easier to get into said college, but actually doesnâ€™t change much at all. This is because students can submit their SAT scores â€œto bolster their applications.â€. This makes students' applications look better than others therefore not having a huge impact on economic and racial diversity. This also had an increase in overall SAT scores, â€œa 25-point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students.â€, which also decreases chances for low-income/minority students.
 
  Something that this new policy does is it creates more admissions. Due to these amounts of admissions there will be more rejections from these selective colleges. With this many rejections it creates the illusion of a college becoming more selective as a whole. With this in mind colleges will adopt this policy to â€œclaim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing.â€. Many colleges are using this policy to gain rankings â€œthat has nothing to do with expanding access for students from low-income families.â€.
 
 Other factors come into play when thinking about admission. SAT and other tests required by colleges aren't the only reason why Low-income and minority students donâ€™t apply. Distance and tuition price also come into play when deciding to admit to a college. â€œstudents are often not aware of discounts until after they apply and receive a financial aid offer.â€ therefore not aware of financial aid. Because of less diversity to these select colleges â€œStudents may also feel they donâ€™t belong...especially if there are few other students from similar economic or racial backgrounds.â€ When looking back at the tests they also cost money which can discourage Low-income students to take them, Low-income students may â€œnot know to take the SAT or ACT or how to prepare for it, might be deterred by the cost of the exam, or take it only once.â€
 
 These factors above help illustrate that providing a SAT optionality might not be the best course of action. There are many other ways in which we can increase racial and economic diversity in selective colleges. Other ways would be to decrease costs of tests or of tuition and make minorities in these select colleges feel more welcomed. These are just a couple of ideas to be able to make an impact on diversity. The Test-optional may or may not be a good cause, but for now it causes more harm than good.

 Test-Optional college admissions policies do more harm than help the lower income and diversified students. In many ways there are articles that support this claim, for example in the article If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again, by Kelly Ochs Rosinger talks about how the policies donâ€™t actually help. One reason as to why the policy doesnâ€™t help is due to lack of diversity. Second, their policy just made their schools look better with rejecting applications coming in and making their schools look more selective, The last reason is even when the schools are test-optional, the more selective it is only makes diversified students not want to attend or even not able to.
 The policy was said to help those who werenâ€™t privileged and diversified to get in, but it didnâ€™t. Even with many applications of students applying, they would all get rejected. The article had said â€œWe found no changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after the colleges went test-optional.â€ So in reality, what was the point of trying to help the low income diversified students if they weren't going to get accepted. The article helped explain that no matter what, colleges werenâ€™t going to help represent the underrepresented students that wanted to get in.
 When colleges adopted the policy they had gotten so many applications, which helped them notice that it would make them look more selective. Like the article stated â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall...more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective.â€ This showed that the colleges wanted to be more selective, but were also forced to. Even they had the choice to accept who would get accepted in that college, yet still chose none of the one who would bring diversity. Just the ones who would make them look better academically and athletically. 
 Even before the colleges had made themselves more selective, students didnâ€™t want to go or simply couldnâ€™t attend those colleges. Now that the selectiveness of colleges has increased , there are many who donâ€™t try to apply to these colleges that choose those who arenâ€™t underrepresented students. In the article, Kelly had said â€œLow-income and underrepresented students face a number of other hurdles...These other things should be taken into consideration when trying to figure out why going test-optional hasnâ€™t been the great equalizerâ€¦.â€ This quote from the article somewhat explains that many students could have felt they donâ€™t belong or that maybe they didnâ€™t have money for selective colleges. Students could have eventually felt left out for being the only one from their background and their economic status.
 In conclusion, before disagreeing with the claim students could have tried harder on their part, thatâ€™s true, but colleges made it harder for the lower-income students and easier for their colleges to get a higher school rank. In the end, the selectiveness didnâ€™t help the underrepresented students, and colleges with test-optional policies did more harm to students than help.

15007790,1/14/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,AXKFNW,Beverly Booker,NULL,"""Reading the passage makes it seem like the test optional does more harm than good on college students. It tells us why colleges started to use the test optional admission. It was a way colleges tried to make it easier for people to get in school and motivated more people to apply. They had noticed that when they made their admission test optional more students started to apply but they really didn't think of the outcome and how it might become harder to get in the school then it was before the test optional admission. 
 So when the universities started the optional part of admission they really thought this would help the students out. In the passage If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again it says â€œthe hope was that it would expand access to the nationâ€™s most selective institutions to groups that had historically been shut out. The reality is â€“ at least at selective liberal arts colleges â€“ the decision by a growing number of colleges to make the SAT optional does not appear to be the great equalizer that many hoped it would be.â€ they had thought this would be a good plan and everybody could have equal opportunities and chances to all get into college and their background wouldn't have to affect it. But they were wrong. It also says â€œinstead of expanding economic and racial diversity at American colleges, test-optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selective, at least on paper. But we found no increase in diversity at test-optional colleges.â€ So, they have kinda made it worse. They have become more selective colleges because the more people that apply the more people you have to turn down for that college. Also says â€œno changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after the colleges went test-optional.â€ So they really didn't help at all for the students with low incomes. Also the passage says they found a 25 point increase in sat. Those could've been submitted from applicants that wanted to boost their applications which the colleges would look at first before the other students.
  So researchers realized that â€œstandardized test scores are strongly correlated with studentsâ€™ economic and racial background. In other words, low-income and underrepresented minority students tend to score lower on average than their peers. According to the passage Standardized tests in college admissions. This makes you think depending on a person's racial background and economics will depend on if they do good or bad because some people are limited to resources. A person who has access to a tutor and has more money will most likely get a higher score than someone who cannot afford a tutor or any materials to help them study for these big tests. They don't have an equal opportunity when it comes to taking this test just because some people have more resources than the next which makes the colleges look at the ones with the higher test scores more than a person with lower test scores. It also says â€œLow-income or minority students may not know to take the SAT or ACT or how to prepare for it, might be deterred by the cost of the exam, or take it only once.â€ Which is true: a person who takes the act 5 times is most likely to do better than a person that can only take it 1 time. The act cost money and some people just can't simply afford to waste the money and some people can just depend on their economic is. The more money a person has the more a person can succeed when getting into colleges. 
 If colleges want this test optional admission to work they need to make it fair on the lower income students. â€œit is important to realize that even if test-optional policies do help, there are other things that colleges must do to expand access for low-income and historically underrepresented students.â€ According to Other barriers. I feel as though it's not truly a bad idea it just needs to be worked on more. â€œWhat I do want to suggest is that the test-optional movement take a critical look at whether itâ€™s achieving its goals.â€ The author feels as though they need to achieve the goal they wanted at first.

 The effect of test optional college admissions
 Test optional colleges create an easier pathway to get into college and it makes less test based and more about helping low-income and underrepresented students is a false statement. The idea of colleges going test optional is for the college to look better so they get a lot more applicants and then the college then later looks better. What the college now does is they will reject more applicants to seem as if they are being stricter and making colleges more â€œselective.â€ All of this was just an image being portrayed just to look better and seem like a good school when they are only getting a lot of submissions because they are claiming to be a college that is a test optional college. 
 The test optional colleges were supposed to help minorities and low income students and it turns out it wasn't helping them at all â€œWe found no changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after the colleges went test-optional. Instead, we found an unintended consequence of these efforts: Test-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall.â€ This just goes to show that what they were trying to accomplish did not happen. In the article it claims that more students come from the top one percent of family income more than the bottom 60% â€œAt highly selective colleges, more students on average come from the top 1 percent in terms of family income than from the bottom 60 percent, recent research shows.â€
 To support my other claim that colleges have been using this test as an optional excuse to seem more selective by rejecting more people because they get more applications. Here is a statement from the article â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. Thatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective.â€ This is how the whole system works, the colleges will get more applicants and then look more selective and just start rejecting everyone. This system seems to be corrupt in the way that it is making it seem as if it is easier to get into the college but in a literal sense it makes it harder for many students to get in. 
 Colleges making tests optional such as the ACT and the SAT for the low-income and underrepresented students is a false claim. The idea had great intentions and was meant to really help the students that are more in need and lower income students who can't afford to take these tests multiple times.Colleges have turned the policies into a way to make them look better by looking more strict and selective. No changes have made and more students in 1% family income households are getting accepted than students coming from a 60% family income household. This creates issues for colleges being unfair and should be stopped to create a more equal chance in college acceptances.

I have many skills that i know and that helps me get jobs faster and quicker. Every job i have applied to i have gotten it because i have many skills.

  If i become a nurse its more because i love helping people and not really about the money. If you narrow down your skills for one job you are closing doors to many chances in the future.

In the text it says â€œ Test-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall.....More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective. That appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankingsâ€. Basically making it look like their school is like Harvard by lowering the rate of acceptance because it makes them look good. Now does that seem like theyâ€™re using this for its true purpose?
 Then what's worse is that theyâ€™re messing with the lower class. According to the text in the article â€œwe found no changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after the colleges went test-optional. Instead, we found an unintended consequence of these effortsâ€. Now isnâ€™t it the test-optional college admission program supposed to help them. Now it's hard enough already trying to come up from the bottom already then they do this. This does not seem ethical at all.
 Low-Income applicants do feel more Now one thing that these test-optional colleges do is discount tuition for students for a need of financial help. But students are not even aware of it until they apply. Many low-income students donâ€™t feel comfortable applying mainly because of the amount of people who come from similar backgrounds. In the text it says â€œAlthough selective institutions substantially discount tuition for students with financial need, students are often not aware of discounts until after they apply and receive a financial aid offerâ€¦.. Students may also feel they donâ€™t belong at a selective college, especially if there are few other students from similar economic or racial backgroundsâ€. Now what does that tell you? 
 So the purpose of the test-optional program was to expand the access to liberal arts schools to students that have not been fortunate enough. But colleges are not even doing that. Colleges have been making their schools look more selective to make them look good. Then theyâ€™re not even accepting the low-income students. So then the colleges are not as diverse and they offer financial aid but the applicants donâ€™t even want to apply because they donâ€™t have many students that lived and are from similar environments. So they just finessed the system basically. This is why I say they are doing more harm than good.

 Technical Skills or Liberal Arts?
 
 
 The majority of people have heard about college before. All the parties, sports games, school clubs, late nights with studying, the FREEDOM. Sounds pretty cool right? Whatâ€™s not cool is figuring out what youâ€™re going to college for. A lot of people struggle to determine what they want to study. Well in this moment, thereâ€™s a debate on whether you should major in Liberal Arts Education or Technical Education. In my opinion you should take a major in Technical Skills. I do understand that a Liberal Arts job can get you ahead in your career faster, however you arenâ€™t prepared for a specific skill required job.
 
 My reason as to why you should go for the Technical Skills major is because of the amount of money you can make. When people go to college theyâ€™re typically going so they can have a comfortable life afterwards. As stated in the article it says, â€œIn Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degreeâ€¦â€ Now I do understand that you have to work your way up to the salary you desire. At the same time if youâ€™re 10 years into your craft and you still make less than those who have a two year Associate's Degree you might need to reconsider your job. 
 
 As stated earlier I do recognize that Liberal Arts helps you excel in your careers. Employers are looking for someone who can communicate and write well. In the text, it says, â€œThose who can write and speak effectively and those with enough background in economics to understand market forces are going to do a lot better than those without such skills..â€ I disagree with this statement. I feel that since youâ€™ve only learned about communication and writing that youâ€™re lacking skills that a job might require. Those with Technical Skills major are already ahead of you and it could cost you.
 
 Technical Skills are the better way to go. With it youâ€™re able to make more money. Although Liberal Arts can help you excel in your career faster you arenâ€™t well prepared for the skills a job may require.

 Do test-optional college admissions policies do more harm than good? 
 Being an upperclassman in highschool has its perks, but thereâ€™s also a lot of business to be handled. On the brightside, freedom is right around the corner. On the downside, taking tests becomes a part of everyday life. A main reason for those tests is college. A specific test that I have in mind is the SAT. Colleges have decided to make the SAT optional with hopes that itâ€™ll increase the amount of people applying to selective institutions and create diversity. I however, do not agree with this decision. Doing this would bring more harm than good.
 Going test-optional sounds appealing but doesnâ€™t exactly work the way it was anticipated to. The influx in applications was achieved but it also backfired. In the text, Kelly Rosinger says, â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective.â€ Due to this happening there was also an increase in the number of rejections making the college look more selective. This can be intimidating and make students feel discouraged when looking at colleges.
 Another issue created from this decision are the submitted SAT scores. It has become aware that these standardized tests arenâ€™t set up for the minority. According to the text, Kelly Rosinger says, â€œAdditionally, standardized test scores are strongly correlated with studentsâ€™ economic and racial background. In other words, low-income and underrepresented minority students tend to score lower on average than their peers.â€ Students that score high are more likely to submit their test scores as opposed to those who donâ€™t.â€ With this being said, there was a 25 point increase in SAT scores by students in an attempt to strengthen their applications. While other students keep their scores to themselves. The impeccable scores are often showcased to the government and magazines making this the face of the college. This causes future applicants to perceive the college as a hard one to get into even if it may not be.
 In conclusion, I understand why colleges went with the optional SAT. It did create a chance to give more students the option to apply to more schools. However, there were just too many side effects that came with it. Colleges had to become even more selective due to the amount of applications that came in, it didnâ€™t create more diversity, and the publicized SAT scores werenâ€™t any help. The optional SAT score was not a great help overall.

Students need to know about the outcomes of the choices they make. By learning more about their major and professions they can choose if that is right for them. Colleges students need to pursue a major focused on technical skills than liberal arts education. Technical skills helps guide students to well paying job and to a major that they will enjoy.
 
 Technical skills help students see what their future will look like before they make their final decision and help prepare students with skills so that they can enter the workforce right after high school. According to College Measures, In Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degree â€” and an average annual wage that is about half that of an associateâ€™s graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenance. Even though the students pursue in a higher degree does not mean they will have a high paying job. Most students graduate with a lot of debt and struggle to find a job opening. How do technical skills students find the right job opening for them? Technical skills help students plan out there pathway before they just pick a major that will not work out for them in the long run. Also, technical skills help prepare students financially and emotionally.
 
  In conclusion, even if students pursue in a high degree than other does not mean they will get paid more. We need to inform students that technical skill can help guide them to a rightful pathway and help them choose a well paying job that they will enjoy. Learning about your pathway and its outcome is way important than just picking any major in college.

15007803,1/14/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,AXKFNW,Eleine Roach,NULL,""" Would you want to have test scores that would make a change to your acceptance in getting a higher education? Test-optional has become more popular to colleges since Covid-19 has affected the world unexpectedly. Colleges have now decided to have test-optional scores in case students have not taken any standardized test or if they do not have a high enough score. This has been a great way for students to have a greater chance of being accepted into admission. This does not mean you will be automatically accepted, which means they can still choose who they want to be in their college. This can still opt out a lot of low income students which is not fair. Test-optional college admissions policies do more harm than good by creating an illusion of being selective and the barriers that come to low income students when determining who is accepted to their college. 
 Even though colleges have become test-optional, do colleges make it fair for everyone to be accepted? The answer is no, with colleges becoming test-optional more applications are being sent which makes the college look more selective. â€œThat appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing. This all creates a perverse incentive for colleges to go test-optional that has nothing to do with expanding access for students from low-income familiesâ€ (Rosigner 1). This provides facts that colleges are creating an illusion that makes them look selective but not for the right reasons. There was even an increase in the SAT scores but it did not have any effect on low income students. â€œThis increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower-scoring students keep their scores to themselvesâ€ (Rosigner 1). Colleges are just wanting their schools to look better than seeking out to help everyone in their admissions process. 
 By being a low income student there are more obstacles to face than being in a middle or high class. They have to fight for what they want, nothing is just handed to them. One of the barriers that they face when determining to apply for college is the cost of tuition. Many students are not able to pay their full tuition so they have to take out loans but no one wants to do that. Therefore most low income students do not apply for college and find a regular paying job. Distance also plays a part in barriers for low income students. â€œThis in turn leads many students to attend colleges that are close to home. Students may also feel they donâ€™t belong at a selective college, especially if there are few other students from similar economic or racial backgroundsâ€ (Rosigner 1). Many students have to stay close to home to help their family pay bills. Some students need that support from other students from their same racial background because if they do not then they tend to not feel welcome or be able to talk to anyone about anything that is going on with them. Lastly, when filling out an application low income students do not have the same support or privilege that other students do. â€œLow-income and minority students, for instance, often donâ€™t have the same access to advanced high school courses. They also have less access to high school counselors to assist with college essays, recommendations, and other materials that go into an applicationâ€ (Rosigner 1). Therefore, it is difficult for low income students to be accepted into a selective college if they do not have anything unique about them to represent in their application. 
 Many people may misinterpret that Rosigner is just trying to make test-optional negative especially towards low income students and implies that students should not apply to selective colleges. However, that is not the case; she is just trying to let students know the truth about why colleges may be going test-optional. â€œThe original idea of the test-optional movement was to interrupt existing inequalities in higher education in the United States. Low-income and minority students are disproportionately underrepresented at selective college campusesâ€ (Rosigner 1). Instead colleges are just acting like they support the movement by receiving more applications so they can reject low income students, which results in the college moving up in rankings. They are also using their students with the highest SAT score to seem like their SAT are increasing because of low income students. Therefore test-optional are doing more harm than good especially towards low income students.
 When people think about test-optional they only see the positive facts that colleges want them to see or hear about. The truth behind test-optional college is that the admissions policies do more harm than good by creating an illusion of being selective and the barriers that come to low income students when determining who is accepted to their college. Selective colleges only became test-optional to move up to a higher ranking by receiving more applications, so they can reject the low incomes applications. This makes it seems like they are accepting a diverse group of students but their not they are still selecting who they want in their school. Also, they created an illusion that made their SAT scores look like they were increasing because of low income students. Instead they were just using a student with a high SAT score because low income students usually tend to test low because they do not have many resources. There are also a lot of barriers that low income students have to face when applying for college that other students do not have to worry about. The cost of tuition is one of the obstacles that low income students have to face because they can not pay for full tuition so they have to take out loans, drop out or not go to college. Distance also has an effect on low income students because some students can not afford to go to schools away from home because they might have to help out with their families. Some students need that support from other students from their same racial background because if they do not then they tend to not feel welcome or be able to talk to anyone about anything that is going on with them. Lastly, when filling out an application low income students do not have the same support or privilege that other students do. It is difficult for low income students to be accepted into a selective college if they do not have anything unique about them to represent in their application. Therefore, selective colleges need to change their ways of being a test-optional school so that they can help everyone in the community and not just students they select. People are going to be needed for this change, people are going to need to step up to college admissions and confront them about their illusion of being test-optional.

 When it comes to college, it has become a place for growth, decision making that determines your future lifestyle, and whether or not you have, or will have, financial and emotional stability. Depending on the type of education you want to major in, determines how useful your skills may be, along with how well your life turns out to be years after your college years are over. While both technical and liberal arts education both have many benefits, I believe that students should pursue a major focused on liberal arts instead. I believe this because liberal arts education offers many opportunities for those looking for a successful career in the future as well as allowing students to develop helpful and important skills they may need when trying to apply for high paying jobs. 
 
 Now, as stated in the text, â€œA liberal arts foundation- which by definition embraces strong writing skills, scientific reasoning, foreign language, analytical reasoning, and mathematics- is the best preparation to meet tides of change.â€ With that statement, it makes it clear that liberal arts gives students many quality skills and tactics that appeal to many employers in many different fields. These skills would give students a wide variety of career choices they may want to pursue when taking on a liberal arts major. Based off what knowledge you develop in this type of education, can also lead you to having a bright future, whether that's in the medical field, field of law, and so on. 
 
 Also, the text mentions a 20-year study that was released in 1981. it says, ""Bell Laboratories found that liberal arts majors progressed more rapidly and in greater percentages than other staff."" This shows that students are more likely to display growth both mentally and physically. With a major in this education, students can open their mind to new experiences because of their newly gained knowledge, which would also do them some good because they'll have both basic and imperative skills. That being said, these students aren't as limited and have a range of different fields they can apply to. 
 
 Although, students who pursue a major in technical education are more likely to have a higher-paying job because they have skills in things like computer and/or electrical engineering. The text reads, ""In Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned master's degrees on music, fine arts, or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associate's degree..."" the text also mentions how the average annual wage of a bachelor's versus an associates degree is only about half. This means students in liberal arts education are less likely to make a lot of money because of their degree status. Even though liberal arts majors aren't as limited as technical majors when it comes to careers, they are likely to be employed at a job that doesn't offer an annual wage as good as careers in the technical field. 
 
 But, just because liberal arts education doesn't guarantee students would have a high-paying career, doesn't mean they aren't able to pursue careers in the technical field. As stated earlier, liberal arts can open a wide range of fields and positions. This just means that with the skills they have, students are more likely to be attracted to fields and positions related to what they majored in, they may care more about working in an environment they enjoy versus the amount of money they make. ""It is, in reality, eminently possible to have it all, including all the benefits of a career and a life shaped by values."" 
 
 In conclusion, I think students should pursue a major in liberal arts education because, even though it may not result in high-paying career choices, it teaches you about values, helps students develop/improve basic, but quality, skills that could and/or will come in handy later down the line. Knowledge and skills gained through this type of education can result in a successful but also worthwhile lifestyle in the future, whether you're making a lot of money or not.""""",,,,,,,
15007836,1/15/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,VC2YXQ,Eris Smith,NULL,""" Test Optional College Admissions: Minority Influence
  by Eris Smith 
 In the article, If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again, written by Kelly Ochs Rosinger, she goes into detail about how most colleges are introducing the optional submission of SAT test results. Usually, students applying to college would submit such test scores to better improve their chances of getting in, but, because of this new addition within most colleges, itâ€™s less of a competition for â€œWho is smart enough to get in?â€ and more â€œWho has the better advantage of getting in?â€. Because of this new option, I believe that itâ€™s doing more harm than good, especially to those who are in the minority. Lower income students are at more of a disadvantage because they donâ€™t get as much representation in colleges as those in the higher income class do. Another big â€œbarrierâ€ is that lower income/minority students are usually less prepared to take a standardized test, such as the SAT because they may not know the correct preparation for it. 
 Initially, the main idea behind colleges adopting the â€œtest-optionalâ€ college admission policy was to â€œinterrupt existing inequalities in higher education in the United States. Low income students are disproportionately underrepresented at selective college campuses.â€ as stated in the article. Although this intention was good, it surely backfired after a lot of students from low income regions became less encouraged to apply to such colleges because of the many berries that became clear to researchers, such as Rosinger herself. Kelly also mentions that â€œAt highly selective colleges, more students on average come from the top 1 percent in terms of family income than the bottom 60 percent of low income families.â€ This also puts a strain on those â€œless advantagedâ€ because of how little representation they receive from such colleges, making them less likely to find the need and want to apply. 
 There are many barriers that have been realised ever since this new policy came about, one of which probably has the most impact on minority/low income students, test preparations. Because of where the students may live, they usually arenâ€™t known to receive many resources that would help them better prepare themselves for taking any standardized tests, alongside the SAT and ACT. Also, the cost of the exams play a big part in why most of these students donâ€™t have the motivation to take these tests. With that being said,it makes it harder for minority students to find value in themselves and their work when they have a low chance of getting highly selective colleges on top of all the issues they face with this policy. 
 Now, because the submission of SAT scores has been marked optional, that should make it easier for low income and minority students to apply for college because they donâ€™t have to rely on test scores to get them into their desired college. It also gives them a better chance of being accepted because it may also increase diversity in most colleges and income diversity at that. But, this isnâ€™t the case. Yes, it improves chances of applying to more schools, but it doesnâ€™t necessarily increase the chance of more diversity nor does it help those of disadvantage because some students may want to set a better image for themselves by taking that test but because they donâ€™t have the necessary teachings and help to do so. 
 In conclusion, I believe that the test-optional college admission policy does more harm than good because it puts low income and minority students at more of a disadvantage than before the policy was introduced. These students arenâ€™t represented nearly as much as those of higher income families and the majority students. They are only, really, used in the sense of expanding diversity in most colleges but even the policy doesnâ€™t improve that expectation. Yes, it makes easier for â€œless fortunateâ€ students to apply because they donâ€™t have to rely on test scores but that also doesnâ€™t make things better because some of them actually want to submit scores and not fall under the stereotype of â€œnot being smart enoughâ€ and so on, but canâ€™t because of the lack of resources.

14521708,10/9/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,AXKFNW,Fatin Nuur,NULL,""" Choosing technical school or Liberal Arts Education, it is such a hard decision since there are so many pros and cons for each option. Technical school teaches a specific skill for your chosen career choice. Although Liberal Arts education teaches you a broad spectrum of skills for your major. I believe that college students should pursue a major focused on liberal arts education, because Liberal arts education teaches you so many critical skills and helps you out in your future career. But also for Technical School there are graduates with bachelor degrees and make much less than a technical skill major, for example electrical. That makes going to technical school seems to be a much better option.
 Liberal Arts Education brings you up to learn so many skills proficient and prepare future employers with knowledge for their career. â€œA major 2015 Hart Research Survey found 81 percent of employers called for improvement in â€œknowledge and skills that apply to a range of fields or positions.â€ This makes many people who will take to consider you because of your already known knowledge and skills. Which many people find that being well prepared without needing much training, is seen as a win-win and also seen as you are serious for this job. I think this one of the reasons why Liberals Arts Education is such a good route to go because it helps with your present and future.
 Even Though I believe that Liberal Art Education is a good choice for getting a major in your chosen career. But one thing about Technical schooling that seems nice is that there are graduates with bachelor degrees and make much less than a technical skill major for example electrical. Which sometimes can make a student feel like they are going to do this major and make less than a person who has a major in a technical skill makes you rethink your decision in going into a Liberal Art Education. â€œIn Tennessee, a graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology, one of the stateâ€™s most common majors, makes around $40,000 a year less than a bachelorâ€™s graduate in computer or electrical engineering.â€ This is such a difference annually which can be a bit offsetting.
 As mentioned earlier Liberal Arts Education is a good option to learn critical skills and prepare knowledge and skills for future employers. But technical school gives graduates a better chance at a higher annual salary than common majors in each state. Think about what you want from your career and choose what correlates with your values. What do you want: a Technical Education or a Liberal Arts Education? You pick.""""",,,,,,,
15007799,1/14/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,AXKFNW,Fatin Nuur,NULL,""" Test-optional college admissions policies do more harm than good. Test optional colleges admissions policies have their pros and cons but if it doesn't benefit both higher income students and lower income students it will probably do more harm than good. With test optional admissions you are looked into even more with your other works you have done and extracurricular activities which sometimes can help much more but not every high school student has many extracurricular activities they done maybe because of personal reasons. Higher income students are able to get more artifacts into showing who they are more without looking at testing scores which can benefit them. There is many reasons why test optional can be a good or bad thing but i feel like low income and minority students are not having the same opportunities as higher income students, Not having all the information given to you as a low income/minority student, and also with test optional universities you are looked into even more to be more perfect.
 
 To start off with high income students and low income students are both students but they both have different opportunities that are seen differently. Which can affect low income students to get accepted to low acceptance rate schools. In this text it says â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective.â€ It'll be very difficult for people to try to get into a specific university due to so many applications because when a school has an option of being test optional it draws in a lot of students who are either struggling with their current testing score. A school becoming test optional will eventually make them seem even more selective since there is more rejection happening from overload of applications for the school. â€œGrades, course selection, recommendations, essays, and extracurricular activities possibly favor higher-income students who often have greater support navigating the college admissions process.â€. It is much easier to get more things on your application and making it easier for higher income students to get into university. Lower income students and minorities work harder to get into uni with or without testing ,in recent research more students on average come from the top 1 percent in terms of family income than from the bottom 60 percent. 
 
 As well as not having all the information given to you as a low income/minority student it can be very difficult to transition to high school to higher education. â€œ...discount tuition for students with financial need, students are often not aware of discounts until after they apply and receive a financial aid offer.â€ Without knowing the discount about the school you want to attend to you'll see the price tag and not what to apply. The common knowledge of financial aid is not known and finding aid for the school you want is usually found out after applying. Which can be scary for low income students who are trying to look for the cheapest higher education they can have. There can be financial aid offers that just need to be looked for then you can have a good discount off of the school you want to attend to. â€œLow-income and minority students, for instance, often donâ€™t have the same access to advanced high school courses. They also have less access to high school counselors to assist with college essays, recommendations, and other materials that go into an application.â€ Overall information and access given to low income students is shown to be far less than high income students which can significantly not make somebody's application look great because they didn't have access to it based on their income.
 
 Also with test optional universities you are looked into even more to be more perfect since there is no test to really base your acceptance on. â€œWe also found a 25-point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications.â€. Even though the school is test optional it shows that students are trying to get higher scores to boost their chances on their application which can make it even more challenging. With a school being test optional you are being looked into even more. â€œGrades, course selection, recommendations, essays, and extracurricular activities possibly favor higher-income students who often have greater support navigating the college admissions process.â€. Possibly little mistakes are seen more better when the school is test optional due to the high numbers of rejections since the application is part of more than a test and grades but relies on you as a student after school which can be a privilege for some.
 
 To sum it up overall, having a school have a test optional application process has more flaws than it should have. It can benefit many people if it was properly done well but it seems it has helped higher income students instead of the low income students and minority students who need it. Everyone can see test optional applications process differently based on their experiences and backgrounds, which can be very difficult to know if test optional does more harm than good.

14521748,10/9/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,WK5M8Q,Henry Aphayasane,NULL,""" Students should pursue a major focused on technical skills and should avoid a liberal arts education unless they plan on moving on to postgraduate education. Liberal arts topics are fine as supplements to an education and as methods to become more cultured but I wouldnâ€™t consider it something to base a career on if a graduate was trying to attain a stable income.
 
 As shown in the text, graduates in Texas with a bachelorsâ€™ degree in liberal arts have median earnings that are less than half that of a student with an associateâ€™s degree in electromechanical maintenance. This means that a student who has spent half the time and half the tuition costs of a graduate with a four year degree is outperforming them by twofold. Furthermore this effectively states that, if the student with the bachelorâ€™s degree was pursuing an education to have a higher future income, they wasted two years and thousands of dollars for tuition. This doesnâ€™t even include potential student loan debts which might hold them back for the next few years, if not longer, from making any significant purchases such as a home.
 
 Cited in the text is a Gallup poll which measured rates of happiness and satisfaction between graduates of an associateâ€™s degree program and graduates of a bachelor's degree program. This poll found that there was no significant difference between the two. This proves the narrative that those students who majored in a technical skill through an associates degree are working boring manual jobs while students with a bachelorâ€™s degree are able to pursue exciting careers is false. I would consider it more sapping to happiness and satisfaction with debts piled onto your plate for the next twenty years because you spent four years majoring in something that employers arenâ€™t looking for.
 
 The narrative that a broad education in liberal arts by itself is useful is largely false. Some detractors might point out that a degree in topics such as economics or a foreign language are vital to communication and a future career in business. I will cede ground to that. Fluency in a foreign language combined with other topics such as engineering, business, and economics is extremely valuable in our current globalized world. Even then, it is still a supplement to other education if a student wants to attain a higher income as, while it makes you more attractive as an employee, itâ€™s hard to base your career on it entirely unless you want to become a foreign language teacher or translator. The only outlier to this would be economics as capitalism is not dying anytime soon and, if you are good with the market, someone will start paying attention. Other than those, a degree in topics such as political science, English, and psychology will require you to obtain post-graduate education in law school or medical school to make a serious high-paying income in order to offset your debts and tuition costs.
 
 Others might argue that a technical skill is too â€œnarrowâ€ for the job market. I also believe this is false. Any significant piece of technology or operating system applies component parts from other fields in order to work. This allows the graduate specializing in the technical skill to obtain on the job education and experience working with other disciplines and skills as well as his own. Not only that, the fact that the graduate only spends two years in education allows him to enter the workforce earlier and obtain experience in communication, teamwork, problem solving, and his field of study. The graduate with the technical skills degree might not be as well-versed in Aristotle or Nietzsche as the one with the bachelorâ€™s degree, but the one with the technical skill sure as hell will have a lot more experience with real world problems and working with other people to solve those problems at the end of four years.
 
 In conclusion, a student that has just turned 18 should think very carefully about what their plan is going to be in the next few years by weighing costs and benefits as it will likely determine a significant chunk of, if not the rest of their life. In my view, an associateâ€™s degree in a â€œnarrowâ€ field is more beneficial if a student does not have a clear aim in life and just seeks to obtain a stable, well-paying profession as it does not take up a large amount of time or money compared to a bachelorâ€™s degree. Studying liberal arts is fine, as it makes you a well rounded and interesting person for a dinner conversation, but I would not base my entire degree and career around it.

 Test-optional college admission policies do not do more harm than good. While they donâ€™t provide any extra advantage towards increasing diversity or improving the quality of students, they also donâ€™t negatively impact the students or institutions themselves as they increase the number of applicants and allow greater access for low-income students. If the goal is to increase admissions rates for low income or minority students, the focus should instead be on other factors such as tuition or counseling.
 
 In the article, â€œIf You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Againâ€ the author, Kelly Rosinger, stated an unintended consequence of removing the standardized test score requirement was the increase in the number of applicants, leading to higher selectivity, and thus higher rankings which are exploited by colleges to look better instead of being in the interests of the students themselves. While this is seen as a negative, it is not; if more students from perhaps lower-income backgrounds with lower test scores are emboldened to apply, then it is a good thing that they take that chance with the possibility of getting in, no matter the actual intention of the college. As well as that, it is a possible two-fold positive that the colleges move up in rankings as well. If a student from a low-income background has an easier time getting into a highly-ranked college, it would reflect better on any possible path they may take in the future for employment that they come from a prestigious and selective higher education institution, allowing them to access higher-paying career fields. 
 
 On the topic of low-income students, then making test scores optional would allow them greater access as well. A standard ACT, with writing, costs around $70.00 USD, a standard SAT with essay costs $64.50 USD. If a family is living paycheck to paycheck, they have little room to spare for a combined total of around $130-140 for a child to take a test when their immediate concern is placing food on the table. As well as that, they also â€œ...may not know to take the SAT or ACT or how to prepare for itâ€¦or take it only onceâ€, as stated in the text. Low-income students, especially from immigrant backgrounds, may not have the language proficiency or money needed to comprehend all the ins and outs of the various scores/tests and take them multiple times to repair any possible mistakes they might have made on their first attempt; compounding that is the fact that unlike wealthier students, they are usually unable to afford tutors, special courses, or books to help them prepare for the test itself.
 
 Many argue for returning to the old way of requiring SAT/ACT scores due to the fact that the unintended consequences of removing them are doing more harm than good and quotas for economic and racial diversity arenâ€™t increasing. To counter this, the fact that they even had to change it by removing test score requirements in the first place is answer enough. The financial and bureaucratic barriers presented to lower income students by the standardized tests have been removed but the elephant in the room is the cost of tuition, housing, and other associated items such as books or technology. These costs, when combined together, can run into the tens of thousands or possibly even hundreds of thousands of dollars which is an even greater obstacle than the tests. If universities really want to decrease economic disparity at their institutions, they should take a look at these issues and address them accordingly instead of just taking one small measure and questioning why it doesnâ€™t fix the problem as the problem is greater than just SAT/ACT scores.
 
 In conclusion, universities should keep, at least for the time being, their present policy of making standardized test scores optional in order to decrease the barriers for lower income students while providing support for other obstacles such as tuition or study material in order to decrease economic or ethnic disparities at their institutions.

 Throughout high school students are told that performing well on tests such as the ACT and SAT are very important for their future. These tests are what students will be graded on to get into colleges and even though they have the means to take them, oftentimes students only have one shot to get the grade they need. Not every high school has the funds to give students more than one chance or the proper tools to get them higher grades. Test optional colleges are colleges that do not require these specific tests upon admission. These colleges are trying to be more inclusive and more diverse to allow more students who previously may not have been able to attend to now have the chance.
 In the article If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again it states that the original idea of test-optional movement was to interrupt existing inequalities in higher education in the United States. While some people believe that this is not what's actually happening, the chance should still remain. These specific tests do little to predict college success and no one should be solely judged on one test score no matter the outcome. Low-income or underrepresented students face many difficulties, such as the high price of college, already have a hard time standing out when applying for these colleges, so giving them any chance to be noticed is a great opportunity. 
 The concerns the author, Kelly Ochs Rosinger discusses are that with the test-optional solution that these low-income and underrepresented students aren't actually being given any more help, that these colleges are getting more and more applications, causing them to be even more selective. Now this may be true and defeats the whole purpose it was intended for, however, there are changes that could be made to help these students instead of giving up on the test-optional route. What needs to be done is evaluating the effectiveness of the test-optional option, and if the efforts do not support the overall end goal, then the efforts need to be redirected in helping these specific students get the chance they deserve. 
 In conclusion while the efforts being made to support these low-income and underrepresented students may not be as successful as many may hope for, the test-optional solution is just one step closer to getting these students the help they deserve. So yes more needs to be done to truly represent these struggling students to get where they want to be, but the test-optional route offers a different course of action that could be the one chance they did not previously have before, making the notion that yes, test-optional colleges have more benefits than they do negatives.

Although, both majors have had good things to offer I feel like overall that the technical skills major would be better especially money wise. 
 
 A major in technical skills has a lot of job opportunities and a lot of careers for a student to choose from. It may not be for everyone though but it does apply to a lot of people especially someone who is interested in technology and math. Nowadays with technology increasing rapidly everyday if you are someone who likes to work with technology the nets technical skills major is the right one for you. Almost everything can be done online now and if you are able to program information for businesses you will be getting paid a lot of money.
 
 In the text from the technical skills it says ""a graduate with a bachelor's degree in psychology.... makes around $40,000 a year less than a bachelor's graduate in computer or electrical engineering."" Which that just shows you there that a technical skills major will pay more especially when it says ""a student from the Community College of Aurora with a certificate in fire protection, which takes less than one year to complete, can expect to earn $865,000."" 
 
 There are a lot of programs now for having an associate degree and as said in the article that they ""have a very high payoff."" A lot of people try to go for a bachelor's degree when there are many jobs just for having an associate's degree that pay even more than the one's for a bachelors degree. Even in the article the authors say ""there are no differences in satisfaction levels of associate's graduates compared with bachelor's graduates.
 
 So, overall if I had to choose one I would choose the technical skills major but at the end of the day each student should choose what they feel is best for their future and that includes getting all the information about what you can get out of that major and that was stated by the authors of the Technical Education essay in the very last sentence to conclude it.""""",,,,,,,

College that have went to test optional have actually made it harder to get into that college. It sounds like it would make it easier to get in but in reality it doesn't. So why do people think it helps well that's because it gives more people a chance but in the bigger picture it really makes it harder to be admitted into the college.
 
 College is already hard to get into as is so making it test-optional eases off the stress right? No, it really doesn't and that was discovered in the text when they did some research and found out that ""test-optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selective, at least on paper."" When you are trying to get into a college that is selective and doesn't have a high acceptance rate your chances become even more slim when it's test optional because no test score compared to someone with a high test score on paper looks worse on the one with no test score. There aren't many test-optional colleges anyway but it just surpassed 1,000 with many of them being selective colleges already.
 
 These colleges have become test-optional to help expand diversity and ""expand access to the nationâ€™s most selective institutions to groups that had historically been shut out."" So far, it is nothing like they hoped it would be. Research shoes that ""instead of expanding economic and racial diversity at American colleges, test-optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selective"". They aren't sticking to the plan and it's not the great equalizer that they thought it would be. Actually, many colleges are using this to their advantage to ""claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing.""
 
 The test-optional colleges have received more applications overall. Many thought that would be a good thing but, it actually led to more rejections and the colleges being more selective of who they would accept. While doing research people found that there has actually been ""no changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after the colleges went test-optional."" Test-optional is actually leading to some kids who do take the test and score high to use that to their advantage to help ""bolster their applications"". 
 
 So, test-optional really isn't helping lower income and underrepresented student enrollment, it's actually making it worse. It really makes it seem like the colleges are having a ""competition"" to see who can have a high ranking. In the text it says ""test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieve."" Students already face many barriers trying to get into colleges as is so going test-optional is actually making it harder and more of a struggle on these students. """"",,,,,,,

As someone who doesn't hold much interest in any technical education I may be a bit biased, but I have evidence and points to back myself and my opinion up. Not only is a liberal arts education becoming more advantageous in our world, but the opportunities that will come up will be more varied. There's also the fact that a technical education may become obsolete overtime.
 
  As stated above, with time going on having a liberal arts education is becoming a better option. For one the overall skills you will acquire from this type of education can be applied in multiple fields and are becoming more important in many careers. The second section of Debate: Liberal Arts Education or Technical Education mentions that ""A major 2015 Hart Research Survey found 81 percent of employers called for improvement in knowledge and skills that apply to a range of fields or positions."" These, of course, will be gained by having a liberal arts education.
 
  Obviously there are some advantages to getting a technical education as opposed to a liberal arts. You may indeed end up with more money choosing this path. The same passage from above states in it's first section that ""In Tennessee, a graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology, one of the stateâ€™s most common majors, makes around $40,000 a year less than a bachelorâ€™s graduate in computer or electrical engineering."" This is potentially true for many jobs, though there is still negatives to this. For starters, going after a technical education often involves putting all your eggs in one basket. With a liberal arts education you learn many things that can be used for multiple jobs. There's also the fact that the moment after this piece was published it was subject to being obsolete due to how quickly the world and specifically jobs change. The example mentions electrical engineers earning more than those who pursue psychology, however psychology is a constantly changing field with more and more opportunities showing up. This is the same for many careers involving liberal arts. 
 
  So, it is clear that a liberal arts education is the way to go. The progression of our world is definitely an opportunity for liberal arts more than any other. While both these types of education are better than none, do yourself a favor and choose liberal arts. You won't regret it!

15007800,1/14/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,AXKFNW,Jack Kampschaefer,NULL,"""Why Test Optional Admissions Is The Wave Of The Future 
 
 
  Getting into high profile schools such as Harvard, Yale, Brown, etc is rather difficult. People who are attempting to get their foot in the door of these specific types of schools need all the help they can get. So, why wouldnâ€™t you want the school youâ€™re applying for to be test optional? Itâ€™s rather clear that having test optional admissions is in fact more of a great help than not having it at all. 
  In If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again by Kelly Ochs Rosinger, Rosinger mentions that â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selectiveâ€ (Rosinger). This isâ€¦ rather obvious, considering more opportunities will of course create more disappointments. Itâ€™s simply the nature of how things work. Not only that, but having a test optional option encourages students who really want to stand out in the crowd to put in the extra effort to make sure they have a spot guaranteed in the school. 
  In another portion of Rosingerâ€™s piece she states â€œWe also found a 25-point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower-scoring students keep their scores to themselvesâ€ (Rosinger). The odds of this being true are nowhere near in the negatives, but it can also be said that Rosinger is misunderstanding what it is to take advantage of test optional admissions. While there are very likely odds that the scenario she mentions is true, the odds are just as likely that students simply didnâ€™t bring up their scores becauseâ€¦ well they now had an option to forgo that. In fact, a lack of a test optional policy would force the lower scoring student to put their score out there for their potential embarrassment, while test optional allows them to keep that off their list and instead show off their other qualities. 
  Now, with all these points against Rosinger and in favor of test optional admissions, this doesnâ€™t mean that she has no point to present. Towards the end of her piece she says â€œSticker price, for instance, may deter students from applying. Although selective institutions substantially discount tuition for students with financial need, students are often not aware of discounts until after they apply and receive a financial aid offerâ€ (Rosinger). While this point doesnâ€™t fully encompass her negative feelings towards test optional admissions, it is another reason why students may struggle to get enrolled. However, with this good point itâ€™s overshadowed by many of the assumptions sheâ€™s making. 
  It is clear that test optional admissions are in fact a good idea, and that itâ€™s negative potentials are outweighed by itâ€™s positive. Students are not required to show their potentially negative results and can instead show off their other talents and accomplishments, meaning that students in low income or underrepresented groups donâ€™t have to worry about a negative score looming over them. The main point Rosinger presents against this option is something that obviously wouldâ€™ve happened in the first place, and the other points actually show why test optional is better. If this opportunity presents itself and a student is in need of it, they should certainly be taking advantage of it. 
 """"",,,,,,,
14521786,10/11/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,VC2YXQ,Jacob Marsili,NULL,""" I believe that students should pursue a major focused in technical skills rather than a liberal arts education. Even though people should do do what they enjoy, my main argument for technical skills rather than liberal arts lies in the average incomes of the future career paths of these different skill sets and the levels of satisfaction this can bring later in life. 
 The income gap between these two skill sets and career paths is very evident. This text quotes a few studies showing the vast income gap of the career paths. One being â€œIn Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degree â€” and an average annual wage that is about half that of an associateâ€™s graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenance.â€ In liberal arts career paths, a lot of the time you are working the same amount to get the same level degree or in some cases, like the one in the study, you are working a lot more to get a masters degree and you are still making much less than someone with an associates degree. The only difference is the career path you are choosing, one being technical and the other being a liberal art. It is very apparent that technical careers allow you to profit much more off of your degree.
 While many will propose the argument that liberal arts career paths lead to less miserable jobs because technical career paths are a lot more demanding, as well as they take more time and commitment. However, the text quotes a Gallup poll that shows that satisfaction rates between associates and bachelors careers being the same. This means that the argument that technical careers are more demanding and therefore lead to less satisfactory lives, is not true. I would actually argue that making less money, while working nearly the same amount for your degree, could lead to significant regret and sadness in the future, making those career paths less satisfactory than technical career paths. 
 However, I do also believe that money is not the only thing to consider when choosing a career. If you are one that values enjoyment and happiness over money, then you should definitely pick a career that evolves doing something that you really enjoy, this is where I see the appeal in liberal arts skills. Many people find enjoyment in things like music and English and they should definitely chose a career that revolves around that if it brings them happiness. For those who do not however find enjoyment out of liberal arts skills, and don't necessarily have a passion for something, I think technical is the way to go.
 Once again, I believe that students should pursue careers that require technical skills rather than liberal arts skills. The reason being that technical careers on average have much higher pay. College takes a lot of time and money to get through in order to get your degree, and I firmly believe that you get more out of your time and money you put into school if you go into a career that has a higher pay. Even though liberal arts degrees have their advantages, overall, technical skills are more valuable and they have a better payoff in the work field. """"",,,,,,,

 As our country does more and more everyday to help underprivileged and underrepresented communities, sometimes these efforts backfire and do more harm than good. Colleges across the nation began to switch to test-optional, meaning that it is not mandatory to enter test scores in the application process. This movement started with Bowdoin College in the 1970s. This was in an effort to make the more selective colleges available to communities that have historically been left out. However, studies and data show that the switch to test-optional colleges is not making these selective colleges easier to get into for these communities, they are doing the opposite. 
 The switch to test-optional for many universities in the United states was thought to make the selective colleges less selective, however, this is not the case. In fact, the switch to test-optional is making these universities more selective. According to surveys and studies done by Kelly Ochs Rosinger, out of 32 liberal arts colleges, none of them showed any increase in diversity after the college went test-optional. Instead, the colleges were getting more applications overall, inherently making the college more selective which is the opposite of what this switch was meant to do. Many colleges view selectiveness as a positive thing actually, and because switching to test-optional causes more applications and in turn causes the college to be more selective, many colleges are changing to test-optional with no intention of helping the underrepresented communities the switch was created for.
 Test-optional colleges are in fact hurting diversity. After the switch to test-optional, studies by Kelly Ochs Rosinger show a 25 point increase in SAT scores on applications. This is because students with lower scores are more likely to not submit their scores while students with higher scores are more likely to submit them. In turn, this rise in average scores in applications rises the national average and makes the once low scores kept out of applications even lower. It is common knowledge that standardized tests like the SAT and the ACT have scores that can be correlated with economic and racial backgrounds. Low income-students often do not know how to take the ACT and SAT prior to taking it, while high-income students have the means to take practice tests. In addition to this, high-income students are much more likely to take the test more than once, while low-income students often only take it once. The switch to test-optional is raising the average score in applications, further leaving behind the underrepresented communities this switch was meant to help.
 The wave of colleges switching to test-optional started as an effort to combat the educational inequalities underrepresented communities face in the United States, specifically in higher education in colleges and universities. However, the switch has done little to close the gap between low-income and high-income students as the switch to test-optional resulted in a 25 point score raise in the average application submitted to test-optional universities, in turn raising the national average, hurting underrepresented communities who, historically, are already at a disadvantage with standardized tests. In addition to this, the selective colleges meant to be made less selective by the switch have in fact become more selective. The switch to test-optional has resulted in a massive increase in applications to universities overall, in turn making the university more selective. With many colleges seeing this as a good thing, they are switching to test-optional without the shared goal the movement had at the start. The switch to test-optional, starting with Bowdoin College in 1970, was meant to help underrepresented and underprivileged communities get into colleges they were previously left out of. However, this movement has resulted in the exact opposite. This switch hurts the very communities the movement was created to help.

Liberal arts education is lacking importance as time goes on, and doesn't necessarily bring any real-world value.

There are plentiful studies that prove that you are much more likely to have a higher income in a career that focuses on technical skill, compared to liberal arts. Money surely is not everything, but it is what allows one to survive, and if one finds a technical job that they enjoy, then they are essentially being paid heavily to have fun.
 Some may say that technical skills can be boring and a depressing career choice, but this is simply a matter of opinion. Liberal Arts Education can be just as boring as a any technical job, and any technical job can be just as fun as any liberal arts career. I personally find liberal arts to be very boring. This is simply opinionated, compared to legitimate studies and statistics that show the betterment of technical jobs/majors based on the income. There seems to be this societal stigma that these technical career fields do not offer much fun or enjoyment, but there are so many technical career fields out in the world, that finding one that is enjoyable seems to take minuscule effort. Fun is relative, and it is solely based off of the person. Technical jobs offer just as much enjoyment and entertainment as liberal arts based careers. 
 Lastly, it is true that liberal arts majors can have more generality, allowing for a broader range of careers, but this can also be detrimental. Having a technical major and skill can place you in a specific job and allow you to rise above the competition. You are more likely to secure a position, if you have that direct technical skill. The general liberal arts major can allow you to be open to many careers, but this doesn't really put you above the competition in these careers. Generality can only get you so far. Also, jobs look for people who have a high-degree of skill that can be beneficial to that specific career, which is offered when someone has that technical degree, instead of one who possesses a general liberal arts degree that may not have any real-world value.""""",,,,,,,

 Most would assume that a test-optional admission policy would make it easier for more people to be admitted into the university. It is actually quite the opposite. The test-optional policy deters people to be more inclined to apply to universities with that policy. This means that a lot more people apply to the universities, consequently making the universities more selective in their admissions. In: If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again by Kelly Ochs Rosinger, this point is reflected as Rosinger states: â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. Thatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective. That appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing. This all creates a perverse incentive for colleges to go test-optional that has nothing to do with expanding access for students from low-income families. This test-optional policy has the effect of colleges being much more critical than before.
 
 Furthermore, the test-optional policies work to create false perceptions regarding the status and rank of the university. With the test-optional policy, the SAT scores are on average higher for the admitted college students, simply because those high scores are the only oneâ€™s being reported. This creates the image that the university holds really high intellectual students and standards. In If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again it says that in these universities, there was a â€œ25 point increaseâ€ in the SAT scores reported. Also, the amount of people applying and the amount of rejections for these test-optional universities is super high due to the test-optional nature of the college, yet these colleges are moved up in the rankings due to the amount of â€œcompetitionâ€ of people trying to get into the university. This is directly stated in If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again with â€œThis results in higher average scores being reported to the federal government and magazines that publish college rankings. Thus, it appears as though by increasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieve.â€
 
 Some may argue that the diversity issue within universities would be aided with the test-optional policies, and although this could reflect a higher level of diversity, there is nothing stopping universities from only admitting students with the highest scores. As stated previously, these universities are becoming more selective, and could be more likely to become more critical, and aim solely for those who reflect success in their standardized testing. The college admission process is still determined by the university, and the simple application of test optional policies may just be nothing more than one mere policy that is looked over by these colleges. In other words, this test optional policy may not be enforced in the way that many may think.
 
 The test-optional policy at first glance may seem like a very good option, but there are many unforeseen consequences, and many reverse effects that could take place. These reverse effects of the policy cause it to do more harm than good, and will only add more problems that are under the radar, and are difficult to solve. These test-optional policies can definitely help in some areas, but seem to be detrimental in many more areas. This policy is nothing more than one that adds a few benefits in exchange for numerous negative consequences.

Some people might say that technical education is more beneficial than a liberal arts education. I personally think that a liberal arts education is a lot more beneficial. Having a liberal arts education helps develop more useful skills that are needed for a variety of different jobs. These skills developed through a liberal arts education include writing skills, foreign language, analytical reasoning, and mathematics which are foundations. Having skills in a foreign language might not seem as important, but developing those skills will be useful to an individual by helping translate to someone who canâ€™t speak the english language or for other situations. 
 The other skills of writing, analytical reasoning, and mathematics will be used in any job setting. These skills hold more value for employers at any type of job than the skills that are learned through technical education since these are skills that are needed anywhere. In the 2015 Hart Survey, he found that 81 percent of employers called for those improvements in a range of different fields and positions. Overall, education in liberal arts educates in careers for community and citizenship. The downside of having a liberal arts education is that the jobs have lower salaries than technical education.
 Others might differ by saying that technical education leads to higher-paying jobs throughout a career. They found that in Texas, students who earned a masterâ€™s in music, English, or fine arts had lower earnings than a student with an associate degree. In common majors in some states have individuals earning $40,000 less than a bachelorâ€™s in computer or engineering. in the long run, benefits from liberal arts education will make that individual student more well-round in the workspace and out in the community. 
 At the end, the type of education a student choose is all determined by what their goals are and what theyâ€™re trying to achieve in life. Every student has different views on what achievements are. Some people might value making more money in a career while others value building a connection with a community and build useful working for any type of job. Despite my opinion of favoring a liberal arts education, it all depends on what an individual feels that is beneficial to them.

Some individuals believe that standardized tests do not illustrate a studentâ€™s ability to be successful during college, but more of the studentâ€™s ability to master the test. Now that most colleges and universities are leaning towards being test-optional, it has opened and closed many doors of opportunities to students. Most of the doors that have opened up by college going moving towards test-optional applications will eventually be positive in the long run. 
 Colleges that take advantage of being test-optional are able to be more selective with their applicants. There are cons to being colleges being test-optional because the number of how many applicants applied has increased and the rejection rate seems higher but in reality, it hasnâ€™t increased. The rejection rate gave the illusion that it has increased because of the number of applicants. With colleges being test-optional, students can demonstrate and reflect their talents and abilities from their G.P.A and their extracurricular activities. 
 Diversity is a big issue for colleges because the majority of individuals are underrepresented minorities and come from low-income backgrounds. Studies have noticed that applicants who come from those backgrounds have lower test scores. Those students may also be dealing with other factors that interfere with their college plans as well. At this moment, there havenâ€™t been any signs that test-optional colleges have any increase in diversity and economic backgrounds. By going test-optional, colleges will gain the opportunity to focus on working towards making their colleges and university more diverse in the future. 
 Minority students and students who come from lower-income families who are planning to go to college to further their education may not know about all the different financial aid they qualify for. Because of not knowing all the different types of grants, scholarships, and loans that many colleges offer, some students may end up choosing a college thatâ€™s closer to their homes to save money or to take care of their families. Selective colleges are not as diverse, so the sense of not belonging to selective colleges because of racial and economic backgrounds is another reason why colleges need to focus on this issue. 
 Overall, there are many advantages and disadvantages to colleges becoming test-optional. So far the advantages have been slim, but as colleges start to focus on creating a diverse environment for their students and find ways to help minorities and lower-income families in the future the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Now that colleges are moving towards being test-optional students are able to demonstrate their ability through school work and extracurricular activities instead of focusing on a test score.

College students should pursue a major focused on liberal arts education rather than technical skills. The reason I believe this, is because it can set you up for a more successful career path. Choosing to do liberal arts will let you have an advantage for getting better positions and jobs. Focusing more on the liberal arts side, it can help you be more prepared applying to a certain position or job. According to the text in Liberal Arts Education, â€œA major in 2015 Hart Research Survey found 81 percent of employers called for improvement in â€œknowledge and skills that apply to a range of fields or positions.â€ Those who can write and speak effectively and those with enough background in economics to understand market forces are going to do a lot better than those without such skills.â€ As you can tell, having knowledge and skills such as writing, speaking, and economics can lead you to a more successful career path and have a bunch of opportunities to have better jobs or positions. This makes a lot of sense because we use writing and speaking skills everyday in our life such as writing checks, signing papers, speaking to customers, and having conversations with people. We have to have the ability to do these skills to progress in life and get things done. This comes to show that college students should focus on liberal arts education rather than technical skills. Some people may argue that technical skills are better to focus on because it gives them better pay; however liberal arts will progress you more faster in positions to then earn more money. I, myself, am planning to pursue a major dealing with liberal arts education in college and I am happy with my choice. Yes technical skills lets you see in-depth what the outcomes are and how your future might look like, but being more prepared and having strong writing, mathematics, and speaking skills is way more important than getting better pay and looking at what the future has in-store for you sooner. One day you will know what your future will look like and you will get higher pay...once you do well at your job. And so pursuing a major focused on liberal arts will get you to that one day.""""",,,,,,,
15007843,1/14/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,VC2YXQ,Kaylee Owens,NULL,""" Since Covid-19 had appeared, it has been impossible for seniors in high school to apply to take the ACT, SAT, and many more other tests. People would be trying to take the ACT and struggle because the people incharge would have to cancel the test due to how bad the cases have been. For that reason, colleges have been giving us the chance to apply with a test-optional choice in their applications. With colleges agreeing to have test-optional admission policies, it does more harm than good by having colleges trick the applicants into thinking they will be accepted, gives the higher scoring students an increasing chance of getting in, and makes the low-income and underrepresented students feel like they cannot apply. 
 
 Figuring out where to go to college is a big decision for peopleâ€™s futures. They help prepare the people to become what they want and after they graduate, it is the people's responsibility to take what they have learned and find their way into the world...to find where they belong. Now that colleges have given the seniors an option to submit their test scores or not, they have been taking that for granted. According to Kelly Ochs Rosinger, the author of the article If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again, she says, â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. Thatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective. That appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing.â€ Since they have changed their admission policies to test-optional, they have been encouraging students all around the U.S to apply for their college. Some people might see this as colleges helping students and will be focusing more on their applications. But the more students apply, the better they look because of them having to reject a lot of students that took time out of their day to fill out the application and the more rejections they have, they get a higher ranking based on selectivity. This shows that this cruel act they do can hurt students. The students who would get rejected would be devastated and then will keep telling and asking themselves why they did not get in and how they are not smart, which turns this situation into a harmful one because of the way the colleges act and how the students react. 
 
 Although colleges do let students have the choice to not submit test scores, some students prefer to submit theirs. Those who do are the ones who get a high score on them. It is a great way for them to show off their test taking skills and how smart they are, but what about the people who do bad on tests, but have good grades and a high or decent GPA? Also for the ones who struggle when they keep trying to apply for tests and cannot go because of them being canceled constantly. Rosinger states in her article how high scoring students have a better chance by saying, â€œWe also found a 25-point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications.â€ Students with amazing grades, a high GPA, and excellent test scores are going to submit everything so they can get accepted into that school. With that opportunity, it will take them to the top of the list of acceptance. But the others who do not have the best test scores have to anticipate whether they get in or not and start to doubt themselves because they believe that it is not good enough for the office of admissions. They start to have negative thoughts and get themselves worked up. Others might think they are still going to give everyone a chance and look at all the applications the same way. Looking at this can cause harm for certain students because of the way they stressfully think about it and how their applications are going to be looked at differently for not having test scores rather than high scoring students who will automatically be at the top. 
 
 Even though most students fill out as many applications as they can, some students do not feel the need to apply for many reasons. Maybe the students' families have barely any money to let their children attend college or that the college is far away from where they live. There can be so many situations that can cause the students to not apply and in her article, Rosinger comes up with some of them by saying, â€œSticker price, for instance, may deter students from applying. Although selective institutions substantially discount tuition for students with financial need, students are often not aware of discounts until after they apply and receive a financial aid offer. Distance may also prevent students from applying or attending, particularly those who work to support families. This in turn leads many students to attend colleges that are close to home. Students may also feel they donâ€™t belong at a selective college, especially if there are few other students from similar economic or racial backgrounds...They also have less access to high school counselors to assist with college essays, recommendations, and other materials that go into an application.â€ The many situations she explains are low-income and underrepresented students do not have enough money, how they cannot go far away because they have to support their families, and the students do not have the same access like the higher-income do like to have a counselor help with materials that go into the application. Looking at this, others might think the colleges will be more understanding if they applied. Not being able to apply to colleges can cause great harm to low-income and underrepresented students because of how they suffer and think that they cannot apply because of certain situations and thoughts holding them back. 
 
 Some people say that the test-optional admission policies do more good than harm because they believe the colleges will be more understanding and it gives everybody a greater chance to have colleges focus on their academic performances, courses, and activities, however some do not get the opportunity to do those things. Rosinger explains that with grades, courses, recommendations, extracurricular activities, and other materials that make you look good on college applications, the higher-income have a greater chance because they have support finding their way into the college admissions process while the lower-income students usually do not have the advantage to take advanced high school courses and other activities like the higher-income students do. 
 
 In conclusion, test-optional admission policies in colleges do more harm than good for everyone because colleges are getting more applicants by encouraging them so they can look better and have the students feel devastated when getting rejected, having higher scoring students advance higher on the acceptance list while others have to stress themselves out, and lastly having the low-income students think they cannot apply for reasons they are in. With a choice of submitting test scores or not, it should be fair and helpful for all students, but it seems to be harmful in many ways. Colleges should look more into the test-optional policies and find a way to level the playing field for all students. Even if it means changing the policy all together.

 According to Merriam-Webster, liberal arts is, â€œcollege or university studies intended to provide chiefly general knowledge and to develop general intellectual capacities as opposed to professional or vocational skills.â€ What this is saying is that liberal arts teaches a variety of things, such as language, philosophy, literature, and abstract science. It also helps develop skills such as reason and judgement. Liberal arts can teach a lot more than a technical education. A strong liberal arts foundation can prepare individuals for more opportunities, show people different perspectives, and prepare them for the real world.
 
 With liberal arts in your education, it opens up a lot more opportunities in the future. Employers look for well rounded individuals that can do many different tasks. In the article, â€œDebate: Liberal Arts Education or Technical Education?â€ it states, â€œA liberal arts foundation...is the best preparation to meet these tides of change. Employers concur.â€ With liberal arts and the variety of skills that come along with it, it shows employers what you can do, and it can come with higher pay or higher job titles. With more skills, you can give yourself the chance to excel in the job field, which can lead to a more successful career.
 
 Not only does liberal arts help you in the job world, they can help you in society. Like I stated in the introduction, liberal arts can teach language, philosophy, literature, and abstract science. All these things are very broad and can have many different views. Learning these things can open your eyes to the different cultures living right next door. You can learn a new language that can help you communicate with anyone. You can even learn different types of literature that can open your mind to a whole new world of ideas. Liberal arts will expand your knowledge and help you empathize with people around the world.
 
 Some people might think that technical education will earn someone more money in the long run. The article, ""Debate: Liberal Arts Education or Technical Education?"" says, ""Students who put narrow training ahead of the liberal learning that educates for career, community, and citizenship make a bad bargain with the future."" However, liberal arts can provide opportunities that will make you more money than in technical arts. One example is speaking another language. If you are bilingual, a company will most likely give you a higher job which means higher pay. Also, abstract sciences can open a wide field of careers that pay really high.
 
 Liberal arts will prepare people for the real world. In our society, there are many languages spoken, many different religions, and many new discoveries. Everyone is always going to believe something different. If a person is educated on many topics, it will help them understand our society better. It will also help them see the world in all ways possible. In the real world, there is a broad range of ideas. Learning these early will prepare individuals for this way of life. 
 
 All in all, liberal arts teaches more and is more effective than technical education. It opens up opportunities, it prepares people for society, and open individualâ€™s eyes to new ideas. There isnâ€™t a downfall to liberal arts because of how broad it is, everyone can learn something that is bound to help them in the long run. It can help them career wise, financially, and even in understanding society.

 Applying for college is difficult, anybody will tell you that. Sometimes, it is more difficult for some than others. The idea of being test-optional for colleges was to give more people the opportunity to apply for their school and make them more diverse. In reality, it has done the exact opposite. Instead of being helpful, being test-optional has been harmful. There is more selectivity in those schools, there has been no diversity increase, and there are many more barriers that are in the way besides tests.
  
 A lot of people believe that the test-optional schools are getting more applications, which is true, but that also followed with more rejections, which most people overlook. This allowed schools to put out a face that they were more selective. The article, If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again, by Kelly Ochs Rosinger, states, â€œThat appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing.â€ The majority of colleges that went test-optional did not do it for the purpose of becoming more diverse, but to come across as a better school in future rankings. They had no intentions of having equal opportunity for low-income families.
 
 The main purpose of making colleges test-optional was to increase diversity and give equal opportunities to low-income students and minorities. Even with the test-optional opportunity, colleges still are more willing to look at students who put in their test scores versus the ones who donâ€™t. According to the text, â€œLow-income or minority students may not know to take the SAT or ACT or how to prepare for it, might be deterred by the cost of the exam, or take it only once.â€ Since they donâ€™t take it or take it only once, they might be disappointed in their scores, which then they jump on the opportunity to be one of the test-optional applicants. When this is shown on the application, colleges tend to accept the students with test scores shown in order to get a higher ranking with the federal government. This, in the end, does not increase diversity because the majority of students who take the test and submit it, according to the article, are students who come in the top one percent in terms of family income, which in the United States is not typically the minority. So not only does the college benefit, but the whole purpose of the test-optional application is diminished. 
 
 The whole idea of being test-optional had good intentions, and many people believe that it still does. However, there are thousands of other barriers that prohibit low-income students from applying or attending college. The negative way the test-optional policies are being used can take a turn if some other barriers are taken away. The article states, â€œWhile efforts to go test-optional are well-intentioned, other factors in college applications may favor economic and racial privilege.â€ Some examples of this are grades, course selection, recommendations, and extracurricular activities. Higher income students have more support when it comes to providing these opportunities and just filling out the application. So, going test-optional ended up not being the best option to make things equal. 
 
 Colleges going test-optional, all in all, did more harm than good. The intention of this type of application was good, but what it got turned into made it a bad thing. Colleges using it to get higher rankings helped contribute to the fact that diversity did not increase. The barriers that are still there are a far greater problem than having to submit test scores. The test-optional policy doesn't necessarily need to go away, though, the agenda just needs to be switched in order for it to fulfill its original purpose.

  A college has a option to accept test optional admission.Many kids that choose the test optional admission are putting themselves into a category that may not be the best choice for them because of the colleges outcome.There could be many reasons for them choosing the test optional admission.Kids should be able to choose rather or not they would like to submit their test scores.In 2021 The test optional admission was convenient for the class of '21 because of Covid -19 virus. Being able to not test or only testing one time hurts a lot of kids' scores(or not having one).Test optional is more harmful than it benefits.
 
 Entering colleges you have over 20,000 kids that are coming from all over the word to attend this university.Taking the act or sat gives the college a general knowledge check on where the student should be placed based on scores.A example in the text says â€œ we found a 25- point increase in the reported sat scores of enrolled studentsâ€. Students that are submitting their test scores are averaging 25 points above the average.Students are starting to over achieve their application so it can get recognized.Test taker have to be more competitive when it comes to entering college.While non test takers easily can get accepted into college.
 
 The test optional policy over all led to colleges rejecting applications more because of the number of the applications that were being submitted.In the text it says â€œtest optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selectiveâ€. A selective college is simply a college that does not accept everyone.Over a third of applicants do not get accepted . 
 Submitting test scores as a student has a better chance of getting accepted than a student that decided to choose test optional admission.Research shows that there was no increase in diversity.Despite the options on grades and test scores this is how selective colleges identify talented students.
 
 Kids coming from a rough background as in economic or racial problems have a reflection on their test scores based upon the low incomes.A example in the text says â€œAdditionally, standardized test scores are strongly correlated with studentsâ€™ economic and racial backgroundsâ€.Being a minority student is hard already coming up in society.Kids have a hard time learning test strategies to know how to take a test that depends on your future.Kids having economic problems have bigger problems like having to work for their family and provide .They would also have to expand the opportunities of different options of low income families.
 
 Having the option to be able to take the act/sat admission has affected the colleges more harmful than it has collectively It's a win lose situation.A campus that has the admission to not accept the act / sat are doing more into profession decision as if your going in for law school you would take that test determining if you can be admitted or not.Which makes sense because even though the act is a common test to know you knowledge check doing the major test gives you a ideal of what you need to know and something that you look forward to taking.

I want to major in social work for my career and the amount of pay they receive in Miami, FL range from 51-76k per year. In the section ""Technical Education"" the text states a question ""But what's the point of having a well-paying job if the work makes you miserable?"" I agree with the question because you can have a good paying job but can be as miserable as a person with no job.

But, making the test optional gives those who have low-income families a better chance at going to colleges that they've been wanting to go to and that's just one burden off their shoulders.
 In the article, If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again By Rosigner, it states that â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overallâ€ which means that since colleges have made the SAT optional a lot of people have took that as an advantage to apply to the colleges that donâ€™t require it. Also, in the text it states that â€œThatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective.â€ This means that even though colleges are making it optional you should at least still take it because they're rejecting the majority of the applications that come through. 
 Even though the SAT is optional, taking the test can give you a higher chance of getting accepted into the school. The text states â€œThus, it appears as though by increasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieve.â€ If colleges continue to make the SAT optional then their ranking in top colleges will decrease. No college wants to go from a high ranking in test scores or whoâ€™s better academically to a lower rank all because they made a major test optional. For instance, if Harvard University or Princeton University lowered their standards as making the ACT or SAT optional they would have a major decrease as being the top 2 colleges in the United States.
 Those who come from financially stable families have a higher percentage of scoring great on tests, others may not. Under the subtitle Standardized test in college admissions, paragraph 1 states, â€œAdditionally, standardized test scores are strongly correlated with studentsâ€™ economic and racial background. In other words, low-income and underrepresented minority students tend to score lower on average than their peers.â€ Young adults who come from struggling households may not have the support from their parents unlike their peers who come from better households. With that being said those young adults may have not been taught the correct way to take the ACT or SAT and with that it can become a barrier to them. Not being taught the correct way or if all they know is to guess on tests then they may not have a drive for pursuing a dream to go to college. 
 In conclusion, certain colleges and universities will not lower their standards because theyâ€™re afraid of losing their pride as being the top college in the United States. Young adults face so many barriers as they enter/leave high school. There is so much pressure on how things should be handled but, some schools donâ€™t care or take the time to get to know the students or their backgrounds. So therefore, some students donâ€™t know the right way of what the bar is set for certain colleges. Making the SAT optional lifts some barriers off of those with struggling households.

 My first reason is that a liberal arts education is more diverse. In the text, the author says, ""There has never been a time when training has become obsolete more quickly than it does now. And the imperative of understanding other cultures and nations has never been as urgent."" This shows that a liberal arts education is more diverse. 
 
 My second reason is that people succeed more in their careers. In the passage it states, ""In a classic 20-year study released in 1981, Bell Laboratories found that liberal arts majors progressed more rapidly and in greater percentages than other staff."" This states shows how people succeed more by a liberal arts education. 
 
 My last reason is that people seem to have a more enjoyable career. In this passage, the author says, ""Those who can write and speak effectively and those with enough background in economics to understand market forces are going to do a lot better than those without such skills."" By saying this, it means that when people can do this they can have a good career which leads to enjoying that career. 
 
 In conclusion, I believe college students should focus on a more liberal arts education rather than a technical education.

 Test-optional policies are a way to decide whether to submit SAT or ACT scores as part of their application process. But do they do more harm than good? Here are a few reasons as to why test-optional policies do more harm than good. 
 
 The first reason was test-optional policies cause more harm is that it increases the chance of rejection. In the article, it states â€œtest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall...that's because more applications typically mean more rejections. This is saying that by going test-optional it increases the risk of the student being rejected from the college they want to attend. 
 
 Another reason as to why test-optional policies cause more harm than good is because it goes against the goals of why it was created in the first place. According to the article, it says that â€œthe original idea of the test-optional movement was to interrupt existing inequalities in higher education in the United Statesâ€. However, more and more students are taking the necessary tests for college and those who get good scores report them and those who dont typically keep it to themselves, and this causes the schools ranking to go up and increases the wants of more students to apply there. Which was the goal of the test-optional policies. 
 
 The third and final reason why test policies cause more harm than good is that colleges may favor economic and racial privelege. In the article it says, â€œGrades, course selection, recommendations, essays, and extracurricular activities possibly favor higher-income students who often have greater support navigating the college admissions process. Low-income and minority students, for instance, often donâ€™t have the same access to advanced high school coursesâ€. This implies that students who minorities and have low-income are more likely to have more support as the students who come from high-income households. 
 
 These are the reasons why test-optional policies are more harmful than good when it comes to college applications.

If a student wants to purse a liberal arts education and has been informed of the reality of such education, that is their choice. Based on information from both of the previous texts, both education styles seem beneficial to certain kinds of careers. Below are my reasonings for believing that it is up to the student to decided whether or not to pursue a technical or liberal arts education. 
 
  The passage ""Technical Education"" says, ""While students have every right to pursue their passions, they should also have information to see what their future might look like if they do."" I agree with this statement. Students should be informed in the same way if they wish to pursue a technical education. The passage later goes on to say ""..fine arts or English have lover median earnings than the average student with an associate's degree in electromechanical maintenance."" This shows that technical educations could earn you more money. But it's not all about the money to some students.
 
  Some may say that one education is more beneficial in the long run but others might feel different. Regardless of what style of education they choose, being educated is what matters. Some might say having a technical education would be better and teach more life skills but a liberal arts education teaches creativity and other skills jobs are looking for. The passage ""Liberal Arts Education"" states, ""In a classic 20 year study released in 1981, Bell Laboratories found that liberal arts majors progressed more rapidly and in greater percentages than other staff"".
  As long as students are aware of the possibilities that come after each education, it is completely up to the student to choose their path. The education you choose should be determined by the career you wish to choose in the future. If you wish to be a computer scientist, a liberal arts education wouldn't benefit you. Picking your course of education should be dependent on your future career plans. It is important to follow the career path that you believe will make you happy and pay you at the same time.

 There are many students who can relate to the struggle of trying to show your potential on the ACT or the SAT. Some students find test taking to be stressful and overwhelming. The stress that these tests bring can cause a student to not showcase the knowledge they hold. For those who are not good test takers, having the option to not submit SAT scores sounds like a great plan. The harsh reality is that it is not helping those who really need it. 
 When colleges chose to make submitting SAT scores optional, the hope was to expand access to the nation's most selective institutes to those who had been historically shut out. Colleges who have made SAT scores optional have not shown an increase in diversity and have in reality made their schools more selective. Since so many students were given the confidence boost they needed without their SAT scores, there were more applications filled out. Since there were more applications than colleges had room for, there were more rejection letters sent out. "" .. test-optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selective, at least on paper. But we found no increase in diversity at test-optional colleges.""
 Since some colleges have made SAT scores optional, those who did well on the SAT have decided to submit their scores in order to make their applications stand out. This caused a 25 point increase in reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increased SAT score report has made the rankings of these colleges go up. This increases competition for a limited amount of seats at a campus therefore threatening the access goals they were designed to achieve. The knowledge that allowing SAT scores to be optional has made the average SAT score go up has created a twisted incentive for some colleges. Some colleges will go SAT optional just to increase their ranking without any regard to low income families or for students who really need it. "" That appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing. This all creates a perverse incentive for colleges to go test-optional that has nothing to do with expanding access for students from low-income families.""
 Those who support the idea of making SAT scores optional to other colleges all have pure intentions but the harsh reality is that it is not really helping those who need it. The true goal of going optional was to decrease inequality in higher education. Research has shown that going optional has not increased equality at any of these higher ranked institutions. â€œFor our research, my colleagues Andrew Belasco and Jim Hearn did a before-and-after comparison of applications, enrollment, and SAT scores among low-income and underrepresented minority students at 180 liberal arts colleges. Of those 180 colleges, 32 had adopted a test-optional policy. We found no changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after the colleges went test-optional. Instead, we found an unintended consequence of these efforts: Test-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective.â€
 In conclusion, the true intention of going test optional would be so helpful for those who really need it. If colleges could figure out a way to include those who are historically excluded from their campuses, diversity would be increased and those who are seeking a higher education would be allowed to have one. On top of stressing about SAT scores, low income students have to worry about other things pertaining to a college education. They worry about costs, being accepted into a new society and having access to certain high school classes. There are many improvements that can be made to the college admissions process and it is time to start trying them out. It is all about trial and error.

14521700,10/9/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,AXKFNW,Natalie Stewart,NULL,"""I think college students should look more into majors that are focused on technical skills. People who have degrees in technical education usually make a lot more money than those that have a degree in liberal arts. I strongly believe that people should do what makes them happy instead of what makes them the most money; but according to the text a poll found that there are no differences in satisfaction levels of associates graduates compared with bachelors graduates. Many people find themselves going into liberal arts and later hating it because of the low pay. I think pay does play a role in truly enjoying your job. 
 
 I think students should have more information presented to them when looking into majors. Google isn't always helpful, and can be quite misleading. There are very many people who go into a field with very low pay, and they end up having debt for the rest of their lives. If you go into a higher paying job it wont be as hard to get your debt paid off in a reasonable amount of time. Not having enough money for things is extremely stressful for many, and especially those with kids.
 
 Many students do not understand the outcome when they pick certain majors. A lot of students have big dreams of making lots of money, but then go into a field with low pay, like liberal arts for example. It is proven that students with a liberal arts major have a lower income than those with a technical education major. For example, in the text it states that, ""In Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned masters degrees in music, fine arts, or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associate's degree- and an average annual wage that is about half that of an associates graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenance"".

15007791,1/14/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,AXKFNW,Natalie Stewart,NULL,"""Do test-optional college admissions policies do more harm than good?
  Research has shown that test-optional policies have actually made selective colleges even more selective than they already were. Test-optional policies began in hopes that it would expand access to the nation's most selective institutions to groups that had been historically shut out. This seemed like a good idea at first, but then when itâ€™s actually implemented we see that it does the opposite of its original purpose. Test-optional policies are supposed to expand economic and racial diversity at American colleges, but this hasnâ€™t happened. It has basically stated the same, so therefore test-optional policies actually do more harm than good. The article, If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Again by Kelly Rosinger, puts into perspective how test-optional policies are not beneficial to the students they were originally meant for.
  As a student it sounds like a great idea to have test-optional policies. There arenâ€™t many students who look forward to taking a standardized test. However, it may actually be more beneficial to take these tests when applying to selective colleges. As colleges go the test-optional route they end up getting more, and more applications. This actually forces them to become more selective which leads to more rejections. 
  When a college has more rejections it appears that theyâ€™re being selective. When a college is more selective theyâ€™re able to get a higher spot in college rankings because being selective is sometimes seen as a good thing. This encourages colleges to go test-optional because they know thereâ€™s a chance theyâ€™ll get a higher spot. This takes away from the real reason test-optional policies were put in place. 
  Students who are minorities and come from low-income homes are very underrepresented at selective colleges. Usually at these colleges there are more students that come from high-income households. Students who are not wealthy should still have the same chance to get an education like wealthier students. It is more of a challenge for low-income students to get into selective colleges because they do not always have the resources they need. Many low-income students have come from low-income schools which is why itâ€™s harder for them to get into selective colleges. 
  Research has shown that standardized test scores do not predict college success. The score a student gets on a standardized test is very correlated to their economic and racial background. Students with low-income can have many factors that decrease their likely hold of applying to a selective college. They may not have the resources they need to help them successfully apply to a selective college. They may have a lack of access to school counselors which is usually the biggest help when applying to college. Some have siblings they have to help take care of, so they canâ€™t be far from home. They may have a parent, or family member they have to help/support. They also may feel out of place if they are different from most students at the college they want to attend.
  Even if schools believe test-optional policies are beneficial this should encourage them to implement other resources that will help low-income and minority students. These students already have struggles that may hold them back from things, and they shouldnâ€™t have to sacrifice their education. In the end we have to remember why these policies were created, and determine if they're actually serving their purpose.

14521755,10/11/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,WK5M8Q,Rachel Miller,NULL,"""A liberal arts college or liberal arts institution of higher education is a college emphasizing undergraduate study in the liberal arts and sciences. Such colleges aim to impart a broad general knowledge and develop general intellectual capacities in contrast to a professional vocational or technical curriculum. Students in a liberal arts college generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including sciences and the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts. Although it draws on European antecedents, the liberal arts college is strongly associated with American higher education. 
  C and most liberal arts colleges around the world draw explicitly on the American model. According to U.S. News 6, World Report, the top ten ranked Liberal Arts Colleges in America for alphabetical order are 3A Amherst College, Bowdoin College, Carleton College, Claremont McKenna College, Davidson College, Middlebury College, Pomona College, Swarthmore College, Wellesley College and Williams College. There is no formal definition of a liberal arts college, but one American authority defines them as schools that emphasize undergraduate education and award at least half of their degrees in the liberal arts fields of study. Other researchers have adopted similar definitions. Although many liberal arts colleges are exclusively undergraduate, some also offer graduate programs that lead to a master 7s degree or doctoral degree in business administration nursing, medicine, and law.
 Similarly, although the term liberal arts college most commonly refers to an independent institution, it may sometimes refer to a university college within or affiliated with a larger university. Most liberal arts colleges outside the United States follow this model. Distinguishing characteristics Liberal arts colleges are distinguished from other higher education types chiefly by their generalist curricula and small size. These attributes have various secondary effects in terms of administration as well as student experience. For example, class size is usually much lower at liberal arts colleges than at universities, and faculty at liberal arts colleges typically focus on teaching more than research. From a student perspective, a liberal arts college typically differs from other forms of higher education in the following areas 3A higher overall student satisfaction, a general feeling that professors take a personal interest in the student education, and perception of encouragement to participate in the discussion. Many students select liberal arts colleges with precisely this sense of personal connection in mind. From an administrative standpoint, the small size of liberal arts colleges contributes to their cohesion and ability to survive difficult times. Job satisfaction is also typically higher in liberal arts colleges for both faculty and staff. The smaller size also makes it feasible for liberal arts colleges to adopt relatively experimental or divergent approaches, such as the Great Books curriculum at St. John or Shimer or the Marlboro's radically interdisciplinary curriculum. Besides, most liberal arts colleges are primarily residential, which means students live and learn away from home often for the first time. The distinctiveness of these attributes was somewhat eroded by universities' tendency to adopt aspects of the liberal arts college and vice versa. For example, several American universities, including the University of California system, has experimented with a cluster college model in which small liberal-arts-college-like units within a larger university form a honeycomb of residential colleges. Besides, some universities have maintained a sub-unit that preserves many aspects of the liberal arts college, such as Columbia College within Columbia University. Liberal arts colleges themselves sometimes cluster to offer greater curricular breadth or share other resources. Liberal arts and liberal arts college In academia, liberal arts generally refer to subjects or skills that aim to provide general knowledge and comprise the art humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. However, most liberal arts colleges also offer courses in subjects that are not traditionally considered part of the liberal arts, such as computer science. Globally Liberal arts colleges can be found in all parts of the world. Notwithstanding the European origins of the concept of liberal arts education today, the term is associated mainly with the United States, and most self-identified liberal arts colleges worldwide can be built on the American model. The Global Liberal Arts Alliance, which incorporates institutions on five continents, refers to itself as an international multilateral partnership of American-style liberal arts institutions.In 2009, liberal arts colleges worldwide formed the Global Liberal Arts Alliance, an international consortium and matching service to help liberal arts colleges in different countries deal with their shared problems. In North America, The liberal arts college model took root in the United States in the 19th century as institutions spread that followed the model of early schools like Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth, although none of these early American schools are regarded as liberal arts colleges today. These colleges served as a means of spreading a European cultural model across the new country. The model proliferated in the 19th century. Some small liberal arts colleges were established between 1850 and 1899. As of 1987, there were about 540 liberal arts colleges in the United States. The oldest liberal arts college in America is considered Washington College, the first college chartered after American independence. Other prominent examples in the United States include the so-called Little Ivy colleges in New England, the surviving predominantly female Seven Sisters colleges along the northeastern seaboard, the Claremont Colleges in Southern California, and the Ohio Five. However, similar institutions are found all over the country. Most are private institutions, but a handful of public liberal arts schools exist. Liberal arts colleges are also found in Canada, including Acadia University, Bishop University, Mount Allison University, Nipissing University, St. Francis Xavier University, and St. Thomas University. In South America, The leading organization is the National Institute of Educators of Liberal Arts and Artistic Education Instituto Nacional Superior del Profesorado, located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. From 1983 to 2013, the institute was part of the IUNA National University Institute for the Arts. Since 2014 the Ruanova Institute of Performing Arts and Higher Education became part of the UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes National University of the Arts. The Ministry of Culture also released a DVD on various creators' life and artistic work, including the dancer Mar ADA Ruanova. In Europe. Except for pioneering institutions such as Franklin University, Switzerland was established as a Europe-based US-style liberal arts college in 1969. Saint Louis University Madrid Campus was established in 1967 and Richmond. 
 The American International University in London established in 197 only recently have efforts been made to import the American liberal arts college model to continental Europe. In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology university college since the late 1990s. This trend was spearheaded by Dutch sociologist Hans Adriaansens who was frustrated with university education's large-scale climate in the Netherlands. Dutch university colleges of this kind include Leiden University College, The Hague University College, Utrecht University College Maastricht, Amsterdam University College University College Roosevelt Erasmus University College University College Groningen, and University College Tilburg. Other liberal arts colleges in continental Europe include Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts in Slovakia, Jacobs University Bremen, Bard College Berlin, the Leuphana University of BCneburg with their Bachelor program Studium Individuale and the University College Freiburg in Germany. Bard College Berlin was founded in Berlin in 1999 as the European College of Liberal Arts, and in 2009, it introduced a 4-year Bachelor of Arts program in Value Studies taught in English and leading to an interdisciplinary degree in the humanities. Although liberal arts colleges, as such, remain rare liberal arts degree programs begin to establish themselves in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree of St. Marys University College Belfast, both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In 2010 the University of Winchester introduced its Modern Liberal Arts undergraduate program. 
  The first of its kind in the U.K in 2012, University College London began its interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences BASc degree with 80 students. King College London launched the B.A. Liberal Arts have a slant towards arts, humanities, and social sciences subjects. The New College of the Humanities also launched a new liberal education program. The four-year bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first in Germany. It started in October 2012 with 78 students. The first Liberal Arts degree program in Sweden was established at Gothenburg University in 2011, followed by a Liberal Arts Bachelor Programme at Uppsala University Campus Gotland in 2013. Liberal arts colleges in Italy include John Cabot University and The American University of Rome in Rome. The University College of North Staffordshire, founded in 1950 in the United Kingdom, was frequently referred to as the Keele Experiment because of its innovative curriculum and emphasis on a scholarly community resident together on campus. The college became Keele University in 1962 and reflected many features of the liberal arts college model. It has been described as the closest example of a liberal arts college in the U.K. This distinctiveness will be reinforced with the new Keele Institute of Liberal Arts and Sciences opening in 2016. From September 2016, Chavagnes Studium, a Liberal Arts center in France, will be offering a -year intensive B.A. in the Liberal Arts with a distinctively Catholic perspective. In Asia, Lingnan University in Hong Kong was established as a liberal arts college in the early 0th century, although it subsequently became a full-fledged university. Ginling College in Nanjing similarly followed the model of an American liberal arts college from its founding in 1915 until forced to conform with the Nationalist educational system in the 1930s. In Zhuhai City, Hong Kong Baptist University and Beijing Normal University opened United International College, which adopted the liberal arts college education system. In Tokyo, International Christian University opened in 1953, defines itself as Japan's first liberal arts college. Yale-NUS College was started in 2011 as Singapore's first liberal arts college as a collaboration between Yale University in the United States and the National University of Singapore. It attracted controversy over concerns that Yale was compromising on its liberal values by opening a college in a country where there are strong curbs on freedom of speech and assembly with Yale faculty members expressing their concern regarding the history of lack of respect for civil and political rights in the state of Singapore In response many existing faculty and students have noted that there has been little repression of freedom of expression at the college and that it provides an excellent opportunity to promote the liberal arts in Asia. Kalayaan College in the Philippines is among the best examples of a liberal arts college in the country.

15007823,1/20/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,WK5M8Q,Rachel Miller,https://learn.thinkcerca.com/teacher/lesson_assessments/7405884/edit,""" The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. Since it was debuted by the College Board in 1926, its name and scoring have changed several times; originally called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, it was later called the Scholastic Assessment Test, then the SAT I: Reasoning Test, then the SAT Reasoning Test, then simply the SAT.
 The SAT is wholly owned, developed, and published by the College Board, a private, not-for-profit organization in the United States. It is administered on behalf of the College Board by the Educational Testing Service, which until recently developed the SAT as well. The test is intended to assess students' readiness for college. The SAT was originally designed not to be aligned with high school curricula, but several adjustments were made for the version of the SAT introduced in 2016, and College Board president, David Coleman, has said that he also wanted to make the test reflect more closely what students learn in high school with the new Common Core standards.
 The SAT takes three hours to finish, plus 50 minutes for the SAT with essay, and costs US$49.50, excluding late fees, with additional processing fees if the SAT is taken outside the United States. Scores on the SAT range from 400 to 1600, combining test results from two 200-to-800-point sections: Mathematics, and Critical Reading and Writing. Although taking the SAT, or its competitor the ACT, is required for freshman entry to many colleges and universities in the United States, many colleges and universities are experimenting with test-optional admission requirements and alternatives to the SAT and ACT. Starting with the 2015â€“16 school year, the College Board began working with Khan Academy to provide free SAT preparation.
 Function 
 The SAT is typically taken by high school juniors and seniors. The College Board states that the SAT is intended to measure literacy, numeracy and writing skills that are needed for academic success in college. They state that the SAT assesses how well the test-takers analyze and solve problemsâ€”skills they learned in school that they will need in college. However, the test is administered under a tight time limit to help produce a range of scores.
 The College Board also states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman GPA. Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in correlation of high school grades and college freshman grades when the SAT is factored in. A large independent validity study on the SAT's ability to predict college freshman GPA was performed by the University of California. The results of this study found how well various predictor variables could explain the variance in college freshman GPA. It found that independently high school GPA could explain 15.4% of the variance in college freshman GPA, SAT I could explain 13.3% of the variance in college freshman GPA, and SAT II could explain 16% of the variance in college freshman GPA. When high school GPA and the SAT I were combined, they explained 20.8% of the variance in college freshman GPA. When high school GPA and the SAT II were combined, they explained 22.2% of the variance in college freshman GPA. When SAT I was added to the combination of high school GPA and SAT II, it added a .1 percentage point increase in explaining the variance in college freshman GPA for a total of 22.3%.
 There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to U.S. federalism, local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and home schooled students. SAT scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local dataâ€”such as course work, grades, and class rankâ€”in a national perspective. However, independent research has shown that high school GPA is better than the SAT at predicting college grades regardless of high school type or quality.
 Historically, the SAT was more widely used by students living in coastal states and the ACT was more widely used by students in the Midwest and South; in recent years, however, an increasing number of students on the East and West coasts have been taking the ACT. Since 2007, all four-year colleges and universities in the United States that require a test as part of an application for admission will accept either the SAT or ACT, and over 950 four-year colleges and universities do not require any standardized test scores at all for admission.
 Structure 
 The SAT has four sections: Reading, Writing and Language, Math, and Math . The test taker may optionally write an essay which, in that case, is the fifth test section. The total time for the scored portion of the SAT is three hours . Some test takers who are not taking the essay may also have a fifth section, which is used, at least in part, for the pretesting of questions that may appear on future administrations of the SAT. Two section scores result from taking the SAT: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, and Math. Section scores are reported on a scale of 200 to 800, and each section score is a multiple of ten. A total score for the SAT is calculated by adding the two section scores, resulting in total scores that range from 400 to 1600. There is no penalty for guessing on the SAT: scores are based on the number of questions answered correctly. In addition to the two section scores, three ""test"" scores on a scale of 10 to 40 are reported, one for each of Reading, Writing and Language, and Math, with increment of 1 for Reading / Writing and Language, and 0.5 for Math. The essay, if taken, is scored separately from the two section scores.
 Reading Test 
 The Reading Test of the SAT contains one section of 52 questions and a time limit of 65 minutes.
 Writing and Language Test 
 The Writing and Language Test of the SAT is made up of one section with 44 multiple-choice questions and a time limit of 35 minutes.
 Mathematics 
 The mathematics portion of the SAT is divided into two sections: Math Test â€“ Calculator and Math Test â€“ No Calculator. In total, the SAT math test is 80 minutes long and includes 58 questions: 45 multiple choice questions and 13 grid-in questions. The multiple choice questions have four possible answers; the grid-in questions are free response and require the test taker to provide an answer.
 The Math Test â€“ No Calculator section has 20 questions and lasts 25 minutes.
 The Math Test â€“ Calculator section has 38 questions and lasts 55 minutes.
 Several scores are provided to the test taker for the math test. A subscore is reported for each of three categories of math content: ""Heart of Algebra"", ""Problem Solving and Data Analysis"", and ""Passport to Advanced Math"" . A test score for the math test is reported on a scale of 10 to 40, with an increment of 0.5, and a section score is reported on a scale of 200 to 800.
 Calculator use 
 All scientific and most graphing calculators, including Computer Algebra System calculators, are permitted on the SAT Math â€“ Calculator section only. All four-function calculators are allowed as well; however, these devices are not recommended. All mobile phone and smartphone calculators, calculators with typewriter-like keyboards, laptops and other portable computers, and calculators capable of accessing the Internet are not permitted.
 Research was conducted by the College Board to study the effect of calculator use on SAT I: Reasoning Test math scores. The study found that performance on the math section was associated with the extent of calculator use: those using calculators on about one third to one half of the items averaged higher scores than those using calculators more or less frequently. However, the effect was ""more likely to have been the result of able students using calculators differently than less able students rather than calculator use per se."" There is some evidence that the frequent use of a calculator in school outside of the testing situation has a positive effect on test performance compared to those who do not use calculators in school.
 Style of questions 
 Most of the questions on the SAT, except for the optional essay and the grid-in math responses, are multiple choice; all multiple-choice questions have four answer choices, one of which is correct. Thirteen of the questions on the math portion of the SAT are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid.
 All questions on each section of the SAT are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. No points are deducted for incorrect answers. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations.
 
 Many college entrance exams in the early 20th century were specific to each school and required candidates to travel to the school to take the tests. The College Board, a consortium of colleges in the northeastern United States, was formed in 1900 to establish a nationally administered, uniform set of essay tests based on the curricula of the boarding schools that typically provided graduates to the colleges of the Ivy League and Seven Sisters, among others.
 In the same time period, Lewis Terman and others began to promote the use of tests such as Alfred Binet's in American schools. Terman in particular thought that such tests could identify an innate ""intelligence quotient"" in a person. The results of an IQ test could then be used to find an elite group of students who would be given the chance to finish high school and go on to college. By 1930, however, Brigham would repudiate his own conclusions, writing that ""comparative studies of various national and racial groups may not be made with existing tests"" The G.I. Bill produced an influx of millions of veterans into higher education. The formation of the Educational Testing Service also played a significant role in the expansion of the SAT beyond the roughly fifty colleges that made up the College Board at the time. The ETS was formed in 1947 by the College Board, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the American Council on Education, to consolidate respectively the operations of the SAT, the GRE, and the achievement tests developed by Ben Wood for use with Conant's scholarship exams. The ETS was chartered after the death of Brigham, who had opposed the creation of such an entity. Brigham felt that the interests of a consolidated testing agency would be more aligned with sales or marketing than with research into the science of testing.
 A timeline of notable events in the history of the SAT follows.
 1901 essay exams 
 On June 17, 1901, the first exams of the College Board were administered to 973 students across 67 locations in the United States, and two in Europe. Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from New York, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania. The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to Columbia University. The test contained sections on English, French, German, Latin, Greek, history, geography, political science, biology, mathematics, chemistry, and physics. The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as ""excellent"", ""good"", ""doubtful"", ""poor"" or ""very poor"".
 1926 test 
 The first administration of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. The raw score of each participating student was converted to a score scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This scale was effectively equivalent to a 200 to 800 scale, although students could score more than 800 and less than 200.
 In order to make cross-year score comparisons possible, in April 1941 the SAT verbal section was scaled to a mean of 500, and a standard deviation of 100, and the June 1941 SAT verbal section was equated to the April 1941 test. All SAT verbal sections after 1941 were equated to previous tests so that the same scores on different SATs would be comparable. Similarly, in June 1942 the SAT math section was equated to the April 1942 math section, which itself was linked to the 1942 SAT verbal section, and all SAT math sections after 1942 would be equated to previous tests. From this point forward, SAT mean scores could change over time, depending on the average ability of the group taking the test compared to the roughly 10,600 students taking the SAT in April 1941. The 1941 and 1942 score scales would remain in use until 1995.
 1946 test and associated changes 
 Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and ""double definition"" questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and 1957, students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in 1958, time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until 1975, students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In 1959, questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in 1974. In 1974, both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time.
 1994 changes 
 In early 1994, substantial changes were made to the SAT. Antonyms were removed from the verbal section in order to make rote memorization of vocabulary less useful. Also, the fraction of verbal questions devoted to passage-based reading material was increased from about 30% to about 50%, and the passages were chosen to be more like typical college-level reading material, compared to previous SAT reading passages. The changes for increased emphasis on analytical reading were made in response to a 1990 report issued by a commission established by the College Board. The commission recommended that the SAT should, among other things, ""approximate more closely the skills used in college and high school work"".
 Major changes were also made to the SAT mathematics section at this time, due in part to the influence of suggestions made by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Test-takers were now permitted to use calculators on the math sections of the SAT. Also, for the first time since 1935, the SAT would now include some math questions that were not multiple choice, and would require students to supply the answers for those questions. Additionally, some of these ""student-produced response"" questions could have more than one correct answer. The tested mathematics content on the SA""""",,,,,,,

I think that students should go to technical schools b/c they have a better chance at having better paying jobs that will get them far in life. People that go to a technical college usually get paid a lot more. 
 
 It has been proven to be true â€œTennessee, a graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology, one of the stateâ€™s most common majors, makes around $40,000 a year less than a bachelorâ€™s graduate in computer or electrical engineering."" and "" In Colorado, a student from the Community College of Aurora with a certificate in fire protection, which takes less than one year to complete, can expect to earn $865,000 more over his or her work life compared with a high school graduate. â€œ in both of these cases these students went to a technical college. and now they are particpating in some of the beast jobs. and their getting a good pay for it.
 
 Although I think going to a technical college is your best choice I understand the benefits in going to a liberal arts college. People say go to a liberal arts college to pursue your dreams and to be happy. While I believe that you should, sometimes your passion doesn't make you very successful. It doesn't always work out which is why i think you should go to a technical college to get a good job to fall back on.

 In the article they say â€œThatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections.â€ due to the fact that the test optional policies more and more students have been applying to these schools. Which means since they dont got room for all of them they have to turn a bunch down. So that means that there will be more rejections. Making the colleges more selective about who they accept into their schools. Causing some schools to have high rejection rates and less of a diversity in their schools. But also with this information it shows that test scores are not what makes the decisions on admissions. 
 
 Also â€œThis increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower-scoring students keep their scores to themselvesâ€ this makes the higher scoring students more likely to get into these colleges that they want. Then lower one's because they don't want them to show college their flaws. Some of the students that due submit their end up in these schools but those w/ lower are now more likely to not get into these colleges. 
 
 In conclusion, the test optional does more harm than good even though it gives a chance for diversity it doesn't end up happening. Because of reasons like the fact its causing more colleges to actually be more selective because they no longer have the test score to narrow it down and they are getting so many applications that they can't school all of them applicants. Or for the fact that now the ones that do put it on the application do it because they have a high school that usually makes colleges want them. Though it was a great idea the test-optional part on applications should be removed entirely so it's fair for everyone. And the financial aid for students should be told to the students before they apply not after.

""81 percent of employers called for in ""knowledge and skills that apply to a range in fields or positions.""

 Some people believe that if you have a technical education, it's something, that you are trying to work towards your future career. That's the biggest misunderstanding that people think when they think of Technical Education. Personally I didn't know that there was two different types of education where students can choose from. Some negatives for a Technical Education are the lack of breaks between classes, which personally can be a challenge for those who struggle with homework or even studying. But don't let that be the reason why you don't want to go too the college anymore, because you get less time. You can always adapt to your schedule, and make different times where you can study, have breaks, or even a cat nap. The positive thing about technical skills, are they can help you get a good job in the future. Yeah if you go to a school with Technical Education it can be boring or difficult, but that doesn't mean you should give up or choose a different school.

 Test-optional college admission does more good than harm. There is more to a student, than a large test. Many people assume that if you did not do well on the ACT or SAT then your chances of college are slim versus someone who has a 1500 and a 36 on the test. It is not based on the core itself but understanding financially for students and parents. According to the article If you thought colleges making the SAT optional would level the playing field, Think again; she states in the ending of the first paragraph, that lower income and minority students tend to score lower than average. Due to the cost of exams, or practice materials such as books and practice tests. 
 
 ACT and SAT should not affect a decision if the student is good enough for college. Many students may do well in school and not on tests. The second paragraph, the author, Kelly Rosinger concludes that colleges must expand for lower income students. Instead of having scholarships for students who are benchmarked high on the grading scale for the ACT or SAT, they should spend more money for students who have lower income or ethnicity differences. There are other ways to create scholarships for students, whether it is extracurricular activities, grades, essays, recommendation letters, or other possibilities. 
 
 When colleges allowed students to have the option to release their test scores, which led to an increase in the numbers of applications. Colleges have opened more doors for students whose situation deals with lower income. Including myself, when I notice all these colleges letting me apply there with ACT scores as an option. However I did realize it would be more competition for those who submitted their scores to college. What we need to realize is the number increase of college applications and not the advantage for lower income students or ethnicity differences, but students who may test anxiety or gotten a low score. 
 
 Test optional college admissions policies are doing more good than harm. The benefits of test submissions being optional help students who come from lower income, testing anxiety, different ethnicity, or those who bench marked low or average. Yes, there is more competition when it comes to college admissions, but when is it never? College admissions should not accept students based on a test, but on grades, recommendations, community service, clubs, and an essay on why they deserve to go to your college.

You need to be focusing on learning things that are going to make you better at your job.
 
 In the passage ""Technical Education'' it talks about how students who had masters degrees in liberal arts had lowering earnings than the average student with an associate. So that just shows you right there that you definitely don't need a masters if you can make more with an associates. If you want to waste that extra year to make less money go for it.

 The SAT being optional for colleges has been a popular topic for the past few years. A question that has stemmed from that topic is â€œDo test-optional college admissions policies do more harm than good?â€ From reading the article â€œIf You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Againâ€ the policies can be a good and a bad thing, but the bad definitely outweighs the good in this situation. It does allow more people to apply to more prestigious institutions because their SAT score is an optional thing to put on the application. The problem was it didnâ€™t really equal the playing field like they thought it would. It put off a feeling that the colleges were being more selective now than ever.
 By making the SAT an optional thing to put on the application the amount of applications that the colleges were receiving definitely increased. This was the goal to give more people the chance to apply and be accepted into these institutions. Also it was to give people of lower income families who may not have had the resources others have the chance to be accepted and create a more diverse student body. Because this was the group that had been excluded from these institutions for a very long time as this quote from the article states.â€the hope was that it would expand access to the nationâ€™s most selective institutions to groups that had historically been shut out. But this didnâ€™t really equal the playing field like they thought it was going to.
 The problem was that it made it seem like they were being more selective than ever as this quote states, â€œtest-optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selective, at least on paperâ€. The hope was for the colleges to not be as selective as they have been over the years and bring more diversity to the colleges. Although in the article it says, â€œBut we found no increase in diversity at test-optional colleges.â€ What they wanted to be accomplished from making the test-optional policy was not happening. 
 Colleges thought by implementing this test-optional policy that it was going to be the thing they were looking for to equalize the playing field for applicants. But they werenâ€™t getting the results they expected because of the many other factors students have when applying for college if they are from low income families. â€œSticker price, for instance, may deter students from applying.â€ This quote here applies greatly to the reason why some students donâ€™t apply to certain colleges because they canâ€™t afford it without the right amount of financial aid. Distance is another big factor because some kids need to work so they can help provide for their families.
 The test-optional policies were put in place for the right reasons; it just didnâ€™t turn out the way they expected it to. If more policies were put into place with the test-optional policies to help students from low income families it could have made a change the way they were expecting the test-optional policies to do. There are so many other factors that keep students from applying to certain colleges where it is because of SAT scores, price, or distance but the colleges need to do more to make it easier for lower income students families to get in. The test-optional policies do more harm than good because they made the colleges seem like they were more selective than ever.

The study found that people who went to college for 10 years for a masters in music,fine arts, or english have a lower median then the average student with an associate's degree.

However Liberal Arts have more benefits long term for college students. Here's 3 reasons you should pursue liberal arts over technical education. 
 
 For one Studying a Liberal Arts makes you versatile for many career options and able to adapt to changing circumstances. This claim is supported in the passage when it states ""A liberal arts foundation â€” which by definition embraces strong writing skills, scientific reasoning, foreign language, analytical reasoning and mathematics â€” is the best preparation to meet these tides of change."" This provides evidence which shows the skills you observe through liberal arts can be applied in different areas. You might get into a profession only to find it isnâ€™t the right fit for you. A great benefit of a liberal arts degree is that you can translate what youâ€™ve studied into many different areas.
 
 Another reason Liberal arts is more beneficial than Technical education is it provides you with a variety of majors to choose from and can fulfill many of your interests while also offering you different skills. It could be something in Literature, Philosophy or even Social Science but you can expect to learn new ways of thinking. These new ways are what most employers look for in new hires. Like stated in the passage ""A major 2015 Hart Research Survey found 81 percent of employers called for improvement in â€œknowledge and skills that apply to a range of fields or positions.â€ Those who can write and speak effectively and those with enough background in economics to understand market forces are going to do a lot better than those without such skills"". This gives you an advantage over many in the Technical field.
 
 You may thinking "" I want a career that offers more financially, which happens to be a Technical one"". This might be true right now but think for the future, is this the best option for you 10 years from now? Because like the Technical Education article said ""Whats the point of having a well-paying job if the work makes you miserable?"". An upside from this however is that the skills you learn from Liberal arts let you change careers being adaptable.""""",,,,,,,
15007842,1/15/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,VC2YXQ,Rudolph Kesseh,NULL,""" Test optional admission policies put students at harm more than ever before. Giving no disadvantage to those who apply test free isnâ€™t the same as giving an advantage to those who have high test scores. Before further explanation of why a test optional policy does harm,you should know what it means for it to be this way. From doing research it is to be understood that test optional means that students get to choose whether or not they want to submit their ACT and SAT scores in which the better the scores the more likely they are to submit it. Yet after reading through Iâ€™ve come to 3 reasons why Universities should stick to the traditional way of making test scores mandatory.
 
 The first reason being that the establishment of test scores being optional is something new for a lot of admission offices around the country; therefore taking some getting used to. These are uncharted waters as they have little to no experience determining if these new waves of students would fit right on their campus. According to â€œIf You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Againâ€, Test-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. Thatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective. This shows there being a disadvantage for those applicants as the option to not give test scores makes the decision even more strict.
 
 Second reason being that other factors take play in the decision making for admission officers yet some of those still dont determine if that student is right for the school so making test scores optional plays little to no impact. These factors affect low income, underrepresented applicants who youâ€™d think would benefit from the test optional choice. These factors include but are not limited to distance from home, low income compared to high tuition fees, extracurricular activities, and family responsibilities. According to the passage, While efforts to go test-optional are well-intentioned, other factors in college applications may favor economic and racial privilege. Grades, course selection, recommendations, essays, and extracurricular activities possibly favor higher-income students who often have greater support navigating the college admissions process. Making decisions without any test scores will require Admission officers to dig deeper and look closer at each students other strengths and better appreciate them.
 
 The final reason test optional admission policy puts students at more harm is that it exposes the weakness of the trait of those students having the ability to take standardized tests. This trait would be especially useful in college (which is where theyâ€™re trying to get intoâ€) because much of college is based on testing because in college youâ€™re given notes throughout the course and given diagnostic tests to see what you know. According to the passage â€œLow-income or minority students may not know to take the SAT or ACT or how to prepare for it, might be deterred by the cost of the exam, or take it only onceâ€ Without this experience and to having the test optional policy leads students to nothing but a pathway of failure.
 
 So with these reasons being stated the conversation needs to go from â€œshould we make standardized tests optional for our applicantsâ€ to â€œ What can we do to benefit our future students and how can we prepare them to succeed in collegeâ€. Like stated earlier, being able to ace an standardized test is least of these students' concerns because if theyâ€™re college worthy their high school transcript and activities will show that. Not only that but how can we eliminate a tradition such as standardized test taking; making that optional is like telling students preparing for college is optional. With all this being said all colleges should reinstate the mandatory status of students taking standardized tests because not taking it puts them at a disadvantage; it's like convincing someone whoâ€™s embraced their culture their whole life to adapt a new way of life.

14521714,10/9/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,AXKFNW,Samantha Hughes,NULL,""" College students should pursue a major focused on a liberal arts education. Although a high paying job is important if you want to achieve financial freedom and keep your life on a steady, stress-free track, it's deeper than money. 
 Taking time to really train and study for your career path is needed in order to succeed. Yes, it seems like a good deal to go to school for less than a year to receive a certificate, and earn a large amount of money. But with a liberal arts education, you would have important skills such as writing skills, scientific reasoning, foreign language, analytical reasoning and mathematics. If these skills are provided for you, it gives you a wider range of fields and positions you could potentially be fit for. 
 An employer is much more likely to hire someone with a liberal arts education than someone with narrow training. The passage states "" In a classic 20- year study released in 1981, bell Laboratories found that liberal arts majors progressed more rapidly and in greater percentage than other staff. ""
 In conclusion, college students should pursue a major focused on liberal arts education over a technical education. I know it may be tempting to go with narrow training, take the easier way out, and get paid. But, having those important skills under belt not only can provide you with many more field options, but they can shape your values, principles, and future. """"",,,,,,,

 Test-optional policies were made in order to give low income and underrepresented students the same chances that students who may be more fortunate have. But is the plan effective? Since test scores aren't mandatory, colleges appear to be less selective which drives a greater number of students to turn in applications. Although it would seem like the colleges would be more selective, the more applications they receive...the more rejections. There are flaws in the test-optional admissions policies that need to be managed well and taken into consideration such as the colleges becoming more selective, there not being equal chances to showcase studentsâ€™ full potential, and the hardships that come with being an underrepresented student. 
 The test-optional policies in our education system are not only failing to succeed, but they are working against the main focus at hand. Because low income students might not have the ability to excel in standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, they are less likely to send their scores in. Students who thrive in standardized tests are more likely to send their test scores in, which shows colleges which students possibly have the upper hand. Colleges will then choose the student who seems to prevail more, making them more selective. According to Rosinger, â€œ Thus, it appears as though by increasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieveâ€ (2).
 Not only is standardized testing a hardship for lower income students, but there are many other barriers that could be preventing the underrepresented student from succeeding. Aspects such as tuition cost, distance from home, and poor academic situations are detrimental to low income students' academic journey. Even though students with financial need have discounted tuition, most kids don't even know about the discount before applying. Also, because some of them have to support families and go to work, distance can be a huge part of college selection. Students are less likely to move far away from home and take a big risk when they have responsibilities they cannot escape. The other barriers such as low test scores, the participation in lower courses, and the lack of materials are important factors that can aid a student in succeeding in completing college applications and thriving at a University. Adjustments have to be made in the education system. 
 Although the intentions of creating the test-optional policies were good, it hasn't quite met the standards. The policies have only made colleges more selective and an increase in diversity was never brought into the schools. In order to continue on the path to brighten the futures of lower income students, greater action needs to be taken!

 Recently more and more colleges have started to not require test scores. This has raised the question on if not requiring test scores has done more harm than good And the answer is no. Test scores aren't an accurate measure of an individual's intelligence because tests like the ACT or the SAT are more about knowing how to take the test than the actual content being tested. Along with how the tests are formatted there are other barriers that can stand in the way of students taking these tests such as learning disabilities like ADHD, ADD, dyslexia, etc.. Other barriers that don't include learning issues could be cost and accessibility. 
 Not all students learn in the same way or work in the same way so testing them all the same is unfair. While there are accommodations that can be requested those accommodations only go so far and not everyone has a diagnosis for whatever mental obstacle they may be facing while learning or taking tests and when asking for accommodations you sometimes need proof that you actually need those accommodations. Not everyone can get a diagnosis or afford to go see a doctor to potentially get â€œproofâ€ because they cannot afford it. 
 Standardized tests are also expensive. The ACT is 54 dollars each time you want to take it. Sure there are fee waiver programs and ways to get the cost down but these will only cover the test once maybe twice. The cost of these tests leaves lower income students only able to take the tests needed once and just taking whatever score they get while other students can take the test however many times it takes to get the score that they want. In the article it states â€œStandardized test scores are strongly correlated with students' economic and racial background. In other words low income and underrepresented minority students tend to score lower than average than their peers.â€. This reinforces the hardships that students face surrounding these tests. 
 As more and more colleges stop requiring standardized test scores it widens the opportunities for students who otherwise wouldn't be able to get into schools with their test scores. This is a positive thing because the more people who have access to a college education they can get out of their financial problems and live themselves a better life and potentially end the financial burdens for their futures and if they have kids their kids not have to worry about money.

14521759,10/11/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,WK5M8Q,Savanna Miller,NULL,""" There is a debate on whether college students should focus on technical skills or on liberal arts education. Personally, I think that students should focus more on technical skills than liberal arts. Some reasons for my opinion would be that if you were pursuing a career, you need specific information, some of the information that is learned in liberal arts might not be information that you use, and the â€œrewardâ€ for technical skills earned is possibly greater than the reward for liberal arts. 
 To begin, a technical arts education is an education that is focused on specific tasks. This type of education is useful because it helps you focus more on a specific career instead of just getting different types of information not related to the career you want to pursue. While learning about the career that you think you want to do, you might learn some information that makes you change your mind and want to do something else which is beneficial in my opinion because it narrows down possibilities. One bit of information that could change your mind on a career would be if it would benefit you in the future. According to the text, â€œAll those who are thinking about making this commitment of time and money have a right to know if their selected pathway ends in the life they envisionâ€¦â€ 
 While some might think that liberal arts is better because some careers ask for a wide range of skills, the text says,â€ A major 2015 Hart Research Survey found 81 percent of employers called for improvement in â€œknowledge and skills that apply to a range of fields or positions.â€ This information might be true, however if the career that you want to pursue is not in need of these skills, then why is there a need to learn them? Yes, some careers need wide ranges of knowledge, but in technical skills, if the career that you are interested in requires this knowledge, you should learn it in the classes that you are taking for that specific career. What i am trying to say is that if your career needs some liberal arts education, then you should be taught while in the technical skills courses. 
 In conclusion, I believe that students should focus more on technical skills learning than liberal arts education. In this argument, I talked about how if your career needs some variety of knowledge, then you should learn it in the technical courses that you are taking, and I also stated that technical skills courses could allow you to narrow down the career that you want to pursue in life.

 Should colleges require students to send in their test scores? Some colleges give their students an option to decide if they would like to send in their test scores, but is having the option doing more harm than good? While there many benefits to having an option to send your test scores, there are many downsides as well. Having students send in their test scores is doing more harm than good. 
 The reason for giving optional test scores is a good reason however, itâ€™s not turning out like people had hoped. Colleges were hoping that if they made sending in test scores optional, then they would be able to have more diversity in their schools. According to an article called â€œ If you thought colleges making the SATs optional would level the playing field, think againâ€, â€œ... instead of expanding economic and racial diversity at American colleges, test-optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selectiveâ€¦â€ If selective colleges are increasing in being selective, then how is that going to increase diversity or give more students opportunities to go to that college.

 Asking to choose liberal or technical teaching, is like choosing between easy money or skills to earn money. While it would be nice to make good money by knowing one skill in particular, being able to be flexible and skillful helps a lot. You can get money for several skills with a little bit of extra work. You will also be able to load your resume for jobs with the skills that employers may not see in a technical school student. I also believe that being able to be an artist, an actor, or any liberal job achiever is a big improvement to you as a person. All you have to think is, should I only be good at one thing, or should I be good at several things.
 Big money is still very much possible as a liberal student. If you are able to show that you have the skills and attributes needed for a job, which luckily as a liberal student youâ€™re blessed with many, you can easily get one of those good paying jobs. Even if you start low at a job, with the extra skills you get in liberal teachings, you will easily progress. In the debate article called, â€œDebate: Liberal Arts Education or Technical education,â€ it states that, â€œIn a classic 20-year study released in 1981, Bell Laboratories found that liberal arts majors progressed more rapidly and in greater percentages than other staff.â€ This further proves that even if you start lower you can get much higher when your skills are put to work. Technical workers might have it easy when it comes to starting off higher, but once they get to the point where their skills end, they fade behind the progressive liberal staff.
 Liberal students have a lot more hidden than you see at face value. Not only do they have skills in their major field, they are taught many more skills that shine on a resume. The article stated earlier states that, â€œA liberal arts foundation â€” which by definition embraces strong writing skills, scientific reasoning, foreign language, analytical reasoning and mathematicsâ€¦â€ The liberal student is gaining several skills that many technical students may not possess. These are a huge help when it comes to a good resume that your employer will notice when looking for a new employee. Liberal students stand out, and these days that's who employers want.
 Being a liberal student will not only improve your chances in a job it will better you as a person. Being able to speak, read, and write excellently will help you in conversation with others and interactions with others. Having creative abilities like art and acting will strengthen your mind and your ability to create original ideas, whether that is for work, home, or events. You will be stronger in life choices and understanding. The article states that, It is, in reality, eminently possible to have it all, including all the benefits of a career and a life shaped by values.â€ It is very possible to have anything you need with a liberal education, and it will help shape your life in the process. 
 Some people will argue that people that get a liberal education canâ€™t make good money. Liberal students indeed start at a lower rate than technical students most of the time, but they are much more efficient at climbing up the ranks because they have distinct features. Jobs will push up people who are unique and efficient, and when faced with a problem, they donâ€™t shy away because it is out of their skill range. The article states that, â€œStudents who put narrow training ahead of the liberal learning that educates for career, community, and citizenship make a bad bargain with the future.â€ They can probably step foot in and be comfortable, but liberal students will step in and step up to the real money. 
 In conclusion, in the long run being a liberal student will help you in the long run get a good job and good money, passing those with a narrow skill range. Being a liberal student can make money, it can impress employers with your resume, and it will help your future and yourself. Donâ€™t let the present fog your future, because with hard work and proof of special skill a person can get a lot farther than you think. Take the time, put in the work, be a liberal student.

15007833,1/15/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,VC2YXQ,Serenity Wiatrowski,NULL,"""Hope For Test-Optional College Admission Policies
 Test-Optional College Admissions have become increasingly popular among colleges in America, but the question is, are these policies doing more harm than good? These policies were put in place because colleges wanted to aid low-income and minority students in getting into college, but unfortunately that may not be what is happening. These policies have caused more students to apply, they also caused only students with confidently high test scores to submit their scores, colleges also did not take into consideration that minority and low-income students may not be aware of the financial aid programs or may not have been helped in making their college application with a counselor, like many other students. There are also the standardized tests that may help in the application process, but even those are flawed. These obstacles seem to be doing more harm than good for the low-income and minority students.
 Firstly, the large increase of applications from students trying to get into college, has caused the amount of rejected student applications to increase as well. Colleges are having to be more selective because there are so many more applicants to go through. The article If You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level The Playing Field, Think Again by Kelly Ochs Rosinger states that, â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. That is because more applications typically mean more rejectionsâ€. This increase in rejection is caused by the increase in applications, which gives the college no choice than to be more selective. However, this increase in rejection and selectivity has caused benefits to colleges and some colleges are changing their policies for this sole purpose. The article states that, â€œMore rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective. That appearance of selectivity enables a college to claim a higher spot in college rankings that view selectivity as a good thing. This all creates a perverse incentive for colleges to go test-optional that has nothing to do with expanding access for students from low-income familiesâ€. Colleges are taking advantage of the fact that these policies are gaining a higher selectivity rate and are joining in for the sole purpose of climbing to the higher college rankings. This application process was supposed to help the minority and low-income students get in, but it seems it is only making it harder for the students to get selected. Also, some colleges seem to not take these students into consideration at all but rather, their own reputations among college ranks. 
 Secondly, colleges have given students the option to keep out test scores in the application, but when students decide to do that, college ranks are becoming higher due to only high-scoring students sharing their test scores.. The whole point of the policy was to give minority and low-income students a chance to get into college, yet the effect of this has caused the college rank to become higher, making it harder for minority and low-income students to get in. The article states that, â€œWe also found a 25-point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower-scoring students keep their scores to themselves...it appears as though by increasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieveâ€. The minority and low-income students are choosing not to share their test scores and it is causing an increase in the higher-scoring students to be the only ones sharing their scores, affecting the college ranking. These students who are showing their test scores are affecting the college ranks unequally, seeing there are many low-scoring students applying as well, it is an inaccurate change. The article also states that, â€œThe original idea of the test-optional movement was to interrupt existing inequalities in higher education in the United States''. While they had a good cause for this movement in the beginning, it seems that they managed to make it more unequal for these minority and low-income students by having only high-scoring students submit their scores and increase their college ranks. 
 Thirdly, these colleges are claiming to be able to help these minority and low-income students, but are not showing these students how to find and apply for these beneficial programs or even college. The article states that, â€œAlthough selective institutions substantially discount tuition for students with financial need, students are often not aware of discounts until after they apply and receive a financial aid offerâ€. These students are often scared to apply because of the application and tuition costs, if they knew they could be helped before actually applying, it would increase the number of minority and low-income students to apply, because they feel safer financially doing so. Colleges are more likely to choose applicants who have support on how to navigate the college application process, which many minority students may not have. The article states that, â€œ...favor higher-income students who often have greater support navigating the college admissions process. Low-income and minority students, for instance, often donâ€™t have the same access to advanced high school courses. They also have less access to high school counselors to assist with college essays, recommendations, and other materials that go into an application.â€ These minority and low-income students are not being given the same resources as the other students making it harder for them to have that â€œperfectâ€ application colleges look for. Colleges need to provide aid in the application process and provide more accessible information regarding financial aid for these students.
 Others claim that standardized high school tests would help with the talented students who are going unnoticed in the admission process. However, research proves that these tests do little for minority and low-income students. The article states that, â€œCritics note that research, however, shows standardized test scores do little above and beyond GPA to predict college success. Additionally, standardized test scores are strongly correlated with studentsâ€™ economic and racial background. In other words, low-income and underrepresented minority students tend to score lower on average than their peersâ€. These standardized tests have proven to be correlated with economic and racial background which is very unfair to the minority and low-income students who have taken these tests. It is hard for these students to get high scores on a test that does apply to their economic and racial backgrounds. These standardized tests do little to show the talent of these minority and low-income students because they arenâ€™t made for their background.
 In conclusion, these test-optional college admissions policies are doing more bad then good for these low-income and minority students. These tests are causing a higher selectivity in applications, which colleges are using to benefit themselves and their ranks rather than these minority and low-income students. This process is also causing an inaccurate rise in college ranking due to only higher-scoring students sharing their test scores; when these college ranks rise, it makes it harder for minority and low-income students to apply. This process also does not help the fact that these students do not know how to apply for these benefits and how to properly fill out the applications. Standardized tests also do not help because they are based on economic and racial background, which is not fair to these low-income and minority students. These policies can still do good, colleges just need to realize what they are doing is not helping towards their goals, they need to review and change them in order to help these low-income and minority students.

Technical skills will help with basically any job that they might want in the future after college.
 A technical education is the way college students want to go if they want to earn a good amount of money after college with their future job. Technical skills will help them find a job that pays off very well, and they would not feel like their years of college were just a waste of time. Like a lot of people I know who went to college do. In the passage about Technical college the author states â€œ In Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degree.â€ That proves that pursuing a major focused on technical skills is better than a major focused on liberal art skills.
 College costs a lot of money, so thinking about what you want to do after college, what you want to be, is a good thing to do before picking what major you go into and what college you go to. Because maybe what you want to be involves a major based on liberal skills, maybe what you want to be involves a major based on technical skills. It just depends on what you want to do with your life, if you want a job that pays a lot of money then your best bet is a technical education. Think about it, if you pay a lot of money to get into, and go through college, wouldnâ€™t you want to go into a job that pays very well to make up for all that money you just used in college. 
 Yes, a liberal arts education may also allow you to have multiple job options after college just like a technical education does, but why would you pay so much money to go to college, just to come out of it with a low paying job, sure it may be a job that you love but it most likely wonâ€™t pay as much as a technical skills job will. If you didnâ€™t pay for college out of pocket, and instead took out loans, if you donâ€™t get a good paying job you're probably going to be in debt for the rest of your life. I know people who have a decent paying job and are still paying on college debts.
 The main reason a college student would pick a major based on technical skills is to get a good paying job after college. Another reason they would pick a major based on technical skills is to have multiple good paying job options after college. If it were me i would pick a major based on technical skills because i would want a good paying job to pay off my college debts a lot faster.

Now the question at hand is are they doing more harm than good? No, theyâ€™re simply just not doing what they were set to do. Which was to allow other minority groups chances at getting into the higher up colleges. They were set to be an equalizer for colleges. Test-optional college admission policies are not doing any harm at all and with a little bit of changes and fine tuning they could be doing a lot of good for all students applying for colleges.
 Test-Optional college admission policies are giving low-income and underrepresented students a chance to apply for colleges they never thought they had a chance at getting into because of test scores. But a lot of other things come into play as to why test-optional policies were not the great equalizer that all hoped. Such as College tuition and costs, low-income and minority students that need financial help to attend these colleges sometimes wonâ€™t apply because they believe they cannot afford it. In the article â€œIf You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Againâ€ the author states â€œAlthough selective institutions substantially discount tuition for students with financial need, students are often not aware of discounts until after they apply and receive a financial aid offer.â€ So basically students wonâ€™t apply because they donâ€™t know that they can receive the financial aid that they need. That alone could be why the test-optional policies are not working.
 Another reason as to why test-optional policies might not be working the way everyone thought they would is distance. Low-income and minority students may not apply to these certain colleges because of the distance away from their home. Mainly those who work to support their families. Some students just might not have the option to go to a college that's very far from them, and might not have any test-optional colleges near them. But that doesn't mean that test-optional policies are doing harm, that just means that some minority and low-income students are just choosing not to take advantage of them for personal reasons. Or just donâ€™t have any opportunity to take advantage of the test-optional policies that some colleges offer.
 Some may argue that test-optional college admission policies are causing more harm than good because they are making colleges more selective. Or that Students who choose to apply with their test scores have a higher advantage over those who choose not to. The article â€œIf You Thought Colleges Making the SAT Optional Would Level the Playing Field, Think Againâ€ states that â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective.â€ But in reality it only appears that way, because with more applications ultimately comes more rejections which makes the college look more selective.
 So although test-optional college admission policies are not doing what they set out to do, that doesn't mean that they are doing more harm than good. It just means that there could be other reasons as to why there's not an increase in diversity like colleges wanted. Low-income and minority students may have personal reasons as to why they choose to not apply, or simply not have enough knowledge about financial aid. Test-optional policies are not causing harm, theyâ€™re not making colleges worse and they could cause a lot of good for students if they were to be fine tuned, in better words find itâ€™s problems and fix them.

You can make large sums of money and have as much sanctification on either side you may choose. Technical degrees as well as liberal arts degrees can both serve you well careers, but choosing the right one for you is the tricky part. 
 
 Technical degrees are only two years and bachelor's are four years. I think this is an important factor to play into effect. Two year degrees will be immensely cost friendly as compared to a four year degree. People often think going to collage for longer automatically means you will make more money, this is simply not true. As stated in the text, ""students who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degree"". This means that depending on what type of bachelors degree you choose will determine how much money you will make.

You may have to take in effect that this was over 50 years ago and times have definitely changed. 
 
 No matter which type of degree you choose there are pros and cons to both degrees. At the end of the day, it is entirely up to you to choose what you think you would be mostly satisfied with. The more education the better so really, you cant go wrong. If you are persistent with what you are doing you can become successful no matter what type of degree you have.

 Colleges in today's time need people of different diversities, ethnicities, cultures, and backgrounds. There are so many different people wanting to go to college for a higher education and long term financial benefit, but many of these individuals face the same problem. The problem is standardized testing. Some individuals who want to go to college canâ€™t score well on these standardized tests and therefore do not have the same benefits as people who do score well. Standardized testing only selects good test takers, and not those who might get a 4.0gpa for all four years of their high school education. Making standardized tests optional at colleges would benefit students seeking a higher education and allow them to play on the same ball field as some of these good test taking students. 
 
 The article states: â€œwith dramatic differences in grades and course offerings between high schools, standardized tests provide one way for selective colleges to identify talented students who might have gone unnoticed in the admissions process.â€ This shows that there are differences between high schools and how they may teach their students. Some higher end schools may get better opportunities and resources to develop and learn skills to become a successful test taker. Other high schools might not have nearly as many resources available to them to learn, so their chances of success are likely to be lower. 
 
 Students who want a higher education don't always make them good at school. This means getting good grades and being good test takers. Some of these students get by with Bâ€™s and Câ€™s , which is still a passing grade, but they might have these low grades because of their test taking skills and abilities. Students should all be able to have the same opportunities no matter the circumstances. In the article, Rosinger states â€œLow-income and underrepresented students face a number of other hurdles that may deter even the most high-achieving among them from applying to a selective college.â€ If students have to work to provide for their families, how can colleges expect them to get good grades and a good score on the SAT in comparison to students who live in stable homes. 
 
 Allowing students to benefit from the same opportunities despite circumstances allows more diversity and brings in more people from all stretches of life. Making standardized tests optional would do just that. Many students would be able to benefit from the same opportunities as students who got good test scores did before. This would also allow collages to succeed because of the selectivity that would come with it. It would make colleges actually look into who would be attending their schools and not just choose top of the class students. This does need to be regulated though to make sure that it is doing more good than harm. Students should all have equal opportunities in being able to obtain a higher education and long term financial benefits that come with a higher education.

A classic 20 year study released in 1981 states that â€œBell Laboratories found that liberal arts majors progressed more rapidly and in greater percentages than other staffâ€. Also stating that â€œThose who can write and speak effectively and those with enough background in economics to understand market forces are going to do a lot better than those without such skills.â€ nowhere does it state or talk about the financial part of things even though you'd be doing something you love to do. 
 
  To sum this up technical skills education should be a major college student focus on. Benign that it has more benefits for their future rather than liberal arts education where it has more to offer while in the education but none more so after.

Students who are choosing the test optional way are putting themselves in a bad position. Instead of it expanding and being more helpful, it's actually doing more harm than good. The test optional admissions policy has made it more selective to get into the colleges that are already selective. It has increased the number of applicants. Colleges have found a 25 point increase in the reported SAT scores of the enrolled students.
 
  The test optional policy was made so that there could be economic and racial diversity spreaded, and also help low income students, but that didn't go as planned. In the text it says â€œWe found no changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after the colleges went test-optionalâ€. Giving that. It led to an increased number of applicants, which made the already selective colleges more selective. â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selectiveâ€. So the more students that apply the more applications the college has to reject. Now it makes the college classify for a higher ranking in the category of selectivity being good. Giving off an unintended result â€œThis all creates a perverse incentive for colleges to go test-optional that has nothing to do with expanding access for students from low-income familiesâ€.
 
  A 25 point increase in enrolled student SAT scores was reported. Colleges going test optional may seem like a good idea until you have some not submitting their test scores because they are low or don't have test scores to show. Then those students whose test scores are high and they are submitting their scores when applying. Those whose scores are submitting there for a one up on ones who aren't. In the text it states â€œThis increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower-scoring students keep their scores to themselvesâ€. Taking away from the goals that the test-optional policy was supposed to achieve. Now it looks as if the college is trying to generate higher rankings, defeating its purposes.
 
  For schools to achieve the goal they're trying to pursue, they have to put forth the effort. You have to seek for students at certain high schools in different areas. Take other steps to recruit these students and help them out. â€œthere are other things that colleges must do to expand access for low-income and historically underrepresented students. This includes recruiting high-achieving students from rural areas or areas with large numbers of low-income or minority students.â€. Even taking steps to having financial help and support on campus for easy access. 
 
  Overall, test-optional admission policies do more hard than good. When universities made the decision to make SAT optional for admission, they had a goal to expand their access. They have achieved this goal. Neither will it be achieved if they don't take the steps to help the low income students. Also to help the university to become more diverse. Do test-optional college admissions policies do more harm than good? """"",,,,,,,

Technical education simply pays off better for students in the long run. Liberal Arts just doesn't have the benefits that technical education does, they won't make it as far in life hypothetically if they take that route. While there are a lot of benefits to going to school for liberal arts, they just don't compare to the benefits of Technical education.
 Within the Technical education programs you are more likely to come out with a higher yearly salary then if you were to get a degree within liberal arts. In a study done on a tennessee student with a bachelor's degree in Psychology, this person makes around $40,000 less a year then a student who graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer or electrical engineering. I believe that this shows the wage gap quite well between the two work paths. As well as the wage gape i understand that liberal arts typically has a higher job satisfaction rate but as adults which do you really need more? That is a very personal question to decide but i personally would take the money over it at this point in my life.
 As a college student youâ€™re typically going to have a lot of debt and loans out in your name. I understand that in times like that you need a steady job with a good income so you aren't drowning in interest in a few years. I think that students should obviously take the patht that you should study to be what will help best support your life. It is a lot easier to start your life with income based on Technical education. â€œIn Texas, 10 years after completing their studies, students who earned masterâ€™s degrees in music, fine arts or English have lower median earnings than the average student with an associateâ€™s degree â€” and an average annual wage that is about half that of an associateâ€™s graduate with a degree in electromechanical maintenance.â€ This shows how much easier it would be for someone fresh out of college to live off of.
 Technical education is the most practical route for college students to take, and i think i've made that pretty obvious. Just because you may not enjoy your job as much doesn't mean you should want to take that huge of a pay cut for your future or beginning families.

15007814,1/14/21,5,Butler Traditional High,Stephanie Barnes,WK5M8Q,Trace Noel,NULL,"""Optional tests, helpful or hurtful?
 Standardized testing has long been the method used by colleges and universities to determine if a student is on par with their curriculum. But, the tests have been criticized for whether or not they only support certain demographics. Test optional applications have been the solution to standardized testing but, is it really helping? Studies show that test optional applications only make the universities have more applications and therefore be more selective on who they let into the school. Does the school actually become more selective? If a mainly white demographic already attended that school then how does removing the test help? Itâ€™s just going to add more of the same people from the same demographic to the school. Standardized testing should not determine whether a student should get into a college. Optional testing would benefit students because it makes colleges look at the hard work students put in rather than 1 test, it causes the students to have less stress when deciding on a college, and it would open up testing for more demographics. 
 Students work all year round doing multiple assignments, multiple projects, and multiple other things that display the education levels that they can reach. When colleges are deciding upon which students they will let into their school, they mainly just look at one test. Not only do they just look at one test, but this test is also very racially unfair. If colleges took the time to look at the assignments that students put so much work into, they may realize that they're missing some of the brightest of the bunch. In the text it states â€œAdditionally taking the SAT or ACT may be a barrier for admissions for students already under-represented at Elite collegesâ€. These students are categorized as â€œunder-representedâ€ due to prior standards and stereotypes the test has created. It's simply not fair that students have to work for so long just to be categorized by a test. 
 Applying for college can be one of the most stressful parts of any student school career. Many students have more stress about the test they have to take, rather than having to apply for the actual college. This creates an entire level of stress that is not needed for students. with optional testing, It would alleviate some of the stress that students are having about the application process to college. From a section within the text it said â€œLow income and underrepresented students face a number of other hurdles that may deter even the most higher-achieving among them from applying to a selective college.â€ In saying this, Students already have a number of things to stress about when applying to college. a test that doesn't even demonstrate all of their skills should not be an added stress within this process. Therefore, This is Another example of how optional testing is benefiting students in the long run. 
 It has been proven that the ACT test has targeted a certain demographic of students to succeed. Normally the students that score very highly on the assessment are within a higher class and have more privileges. This takes out many more students who are capable of so much more than they are given credit for. Having the test optional route allows students not within the stereotyped demographic to be seen for what they can do. These students would not have to take this test, they would get many benefits and opportunities that they never thought they could. This is another pro for optional testing, but this theory has been tested once before. According to the text Researchers Andrew Belasco and Jim Hearn dad adapted the idea of optional testing to see if it would change the demographics of students. They said â€œWe found no changes in low-income and underrepresented student enrollment after college has gone test optional.â€ Although it did not work for this specific College, that doesn't mean that this idea wonâ€™t work for other colleges. With this being such a new route, it still needs some altering but overall it benefits students more than harming them.
 Optional testing is an idea that was introduced to students after all of the catastrophes they have gone through this year. There are so many benefits that come with this idea of not having to use test scores in applying for college. students in the not stereotypical demographic would get more opportunities, students would not have as much stress on their shoulders when applying to their college, and students would be seen for the work they put in for so many years. Optional testing seems to be the best route for students in this decade.

Although junior year I was on the fence,I was looking up any alternative option possible so I didn't have to go to school, because I'm just not a school person and feel like I had enough.

 Test Optional Admissions For The Win
 
 Test optional classes are a good thing . It would help make an equal playing ground in the long run once revisions are made to make it better, but starting now is a great idea. Many students donâ€™t even go to college due to the fact they didnâ€™t get into the college they wanted to, and that should be far from the reason to not go. Sometimes itâ€™s the school's fault for not being ready for the tests that are required to get into that college, and your choice of school and how they teach shouldnâ€™t reflect the college you go to.
 A big unfair advantage is for those that arenâ€™t that financially afloat . Those who arenâ€™t as well off as other students might have a hard time because they donâ€™t know how or never prepared properly for the test. The article says â€œLow-income or minority students may not know to take the SAT or ACT or how to prepare for it, might be deterred by the cost of the exam, or take it only once.â€ In that instance it wouldnâ€™t be fair to decline a decent student who didnâ€™t do so good on the SAT or ACT but only took it once due to financial reasons, compared to a student who took it 5 times just to get in.
 Another issue is the price of college itself. Let's say a student wants to go to college but immediately turns their head to it due to the price. Even if a student was to see that the college was a college that didn't require a test to be taken for admission they know they wouldnâ€™t be able to afford it. The text says â€œAlthough selective institutions substantially discount tuition for students with financial need, students are often not aware of discounts until after they apply and receive a financial aid offer.â€ So even with the assistance and discounts the student is getting it wouldnâ€™t matter because the college didnâ€™t do a good job promoting it to those who are looking for it. Almost as if they try to hide it on purpose to detour students who need it.
 Although this plan is a great idea it has its drawbacks. With no tests being needed to take to apply obviously that will increase the rate of students that apply. Thus making the selective rate being more strict because the college canâ€™t accept everyone. When this happens it also tends to make the college higher on the rankings because those students who got in and did good on the test that arenâ€™t required will share their scores compared to the ones who didnâ€™t do good not sharing their score at all. As the text says â€œIncreasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieve.â€ Granted this is still a great idea and not all things are perfect on the first try.
 At the end of the day this is still a great idea, because it helps more students be able to go to the college they want to without letting their background affect them. Why should a student be able to have a fair chance to change their background? Thatâ€™s the reason for the constant cycle without room for alteration. With more students going to the school, the school will obviously be getting more money which could be used to help expand the school TO accept more students under the no test needed plan. All things considered this is giving more students the same shot.

 Level playing field more like unlevel Battle ground
 As colleges have begun to make SAT scores not mandatory for admission a question has arised. As students feel revelved they don't have to relay this sometimes embarrassing scores. But it may have caused a far greater competition pool to get accepted. Was this a mistake or is it for the better or will it cause an academic war. 
 
 From the decision to not make SAT score a requirement the effects immediately began to be studied. According to the article â€œThat may come as sobering news to those who celebrated the fact that the number of colleges that have gone test-optional recently surpassed 1,000. Despite that milestone, research that colleagues and I conducted shows that instead of expanding economic and racial diversity at American colleges, test-optional policies have actually served to make selective colleges even more selectiveâ€. As the number of these collages were beginning to be widespread the effects already started to show more selectiveness with the larger pool of potential students.
 
 As the no test required trend started to spread it came to no surprise that the colleges had just gained many eager potential students. But this comes at a price â€œTest-optional policies led to an increase in the number of applications overall. That necessarily forced the colleges to become more selective. Thatâ€™s because more applications typically mean more rejections. More rejections make it look like the colleges are being more selective.â€. This is very discouraging for the students and puts an image out there they won't be able to be accepted even if they apply going into the future after this standard has been set.
 This has also had an effect on the SAT scores that come into the college according to the article, â€œWe also found a 25-point increase in the reported SAT scores of enrolled students. This increase may be driven by higher-scoring students being more likely to submit scores to bolster their applications. Meanwhile, lower-scoring students keep their scores to themselves. This results in higher average scores being reported to the federal government and magazines that publish college rankingsâ€. While this is outstanding news for the colleges it causes students with low confidence in there scores to hide them causing them to be overlooked.
 
 My final piece of evidence comes from the very paragraph of the last piece of evidence, â€œThus, it appears as though by increasing competition for a limited number of seats on campus and increasing the SAT scores used to generate college rankings, test-optional policies may actually threaten the very access goals they were designed to achieveâ€. I believe this to be so. This new lack of requirement may hurt the future of these students. In a way it's like social darwinism but with intelligence. The top percent of intelligent people will have a easy time getting accepted but the average people who rely on trying there hardest to get in will be left in the dust which in turn could push a false narrative in the future to come.
 
 At the end of the day its up to us to decide whether or not this will cause us to work harder or give up. It's time for our generation to speak up for our future so we can secure a good life for generations to come.
