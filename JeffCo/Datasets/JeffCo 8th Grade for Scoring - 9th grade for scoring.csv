I can save your life and maybe your families lives too.Alright so distracted driving is a big problem that can cost lives, while the majority of drivers are so-called â€œdistracted driversâ€ behind the wheel. Most of them don't know that, or just don't want to believe it.The main reason why they are so-called distracted drivers is because they constantly feel like they need to be on social media. Imagine if you were a pilot of a plane you won't be playing on your phone, while driving. That is because your brain is telling you it is very dangerous to be playing on your phone in that scenario. So instead of making laws that prohibit distracted driving it is best to change the drivers mentalities first.
 Don't believe me here is why, â€œJoe Farrow, commissioner of the California Highway Patrol, agreed, saying that drivers should think of driving as they do flying: There will be a set period of travel time when there are no calls made, texts exchanged or emails sent.â€. My first evidence supports my claim that drivers should imagine driving their cars as driving an airplane. So if they were to do it they will not feel a sense of urgency to be constantly on their phones. My evidence was â€œJoe Farrow, commissioner of the California Highway Patrol, agreed, saying that drivers should think of driving as they do flying: There will be a set period of travel time when there are no calls made, texts exchanged or emails sent.â€. So this piece of evidence from the text states exactly what i just said so that's how it supports my reasoning. 
 Another evidence is â€œRather than focus on how technology can get around or force a behavior, Iâ€™d like to move further downstream and find ways for people to make the right decision beforehand.â€. my second piece of evidence it states how drivers need to make their decision before hand and have a different mentality beforehand. My evidence was â€œRather than focus on how technology can get around or force a behavior, Iâ€™d like to move further downstream and find ways for people to make the right decision beforehand.â€. This is basically saying what I said in my claim that drivers need to change their mentality first so it supports my claim.
 Here is my third piece of evidence ""Ward suggested one solution might be to shift social norms to deemphasize instant information gratification and move away from the expectation that people should always be on and constantly connected."" my third piece of evidence It talks about how people need to stop being too addicted and not feel the need to reply or post right away. So as you can see I stated that in my claim and it shows how a researcher also thinks that if we take this plan things will work out better. 
 So you might have noticed how car industries have been updating their cars technology to where drivers can instantly use their phone in a blink of an eye. Also you may have noticed that drivers can now update Facebook via their Mercedes and will be able to chit-chat with Siri while driving. Well if car companies are working to make it easy to access social media you would think that it won't cause a problem but unfortunately you are wrong. Drivers will still be driving and what will they be doing while driving? They will be â€œdistractedâ€ on their phones or social media which still is the same thing and the problem that distracted drivers face will still be there forever.
 Finally have you ever found yourself so addicted to your phone you felt like it was glued to your hand. If you were driving while playing on it you should be thankful that you made it out alive. In the U.S 2,800 people were killed because of distracted driving and 400,000 were injured because of distracted driving. So after reading this i hope i have convinced you are at least i convinced you a little that distracted driving is a bad problem and you should never ever do it again. """"",2,4,3,4,4,3,4

This is because people are not getting clean and well filtered water. But many engineers have figured out ideas of solving this problem. Although they are not guaranteed to work. we have been given three different types of solutions one is using xylem sticks from trees to trap water. The second is putting water in clear bottles in the sun for several hours to kill the germs. The third is using very cheap and reusable nano tubes which is made out of thin silver wire to kill germs.
 Although using xylem stick to trap germs may be an efficient way to kill germs because in the text it says ""Almost 100 percent of the test bacteria (Escherichia coli) were trapped!"". This solution is not the best because it will not be reusable and it will be slowing the process of making filtered water.The second solution is using water bottles to put water in and then wait until all the germs are killed after about 6 hours. This solution also does not state weather or not most of the germs were killed also this solution will take a really long time and will not catch up to the needs of the people.
 The third and final solution is having nanotubes wich is made out of silver mesh and it is reusable and very cheap. Then the next step is having water flow down through the tubes and whiles it goes down 98% of the germs die and this process is 80,000 times faster than other filters as stated in the text. ""It workedâ€”98 percent of the bacteria were killed! And â€¨by electrifying the device with a small solar panel, it is 80,000 times faster than other filters."". the reason why the nanotubes are reusable is because it does not trap the germs but it kills the germs as stated in the text "" the device doesnâ€™t get clogged.

Driving education is usually only teaching the driver how to drive, but it should also be teaching proper driving etiquette and when is an appropriate time to use your phone. Distracted driving not only stems from the driverâ€™s education; it also stems from technology and society. Peer pressure also may play a role in distracted driving because media influencers and social media stars sometimes can make it seem as though having your phone out while driving is okay, but it isnâ€™t and people should learn that. If we were to teach young drivers about how to get into the ideal driver mindset, then the roads would be much safer because it is proven that learning good habits young helps to maintain those habits. Being able to implement those habits into the driversâ€™ minds will decrease the risk of car accidents and keep everyone else out of more danger. You may think that we should just change the technology so that it will stop working while the car is moving, but it would be much more efficient to target not only technology but also the driversâ€™ mindsets. You may think that you are safe from distracted driving, but you arenâ€™t the only one out on the road. In conclusion, without new ways to implement good habits in drivers; we wonâ€™t see any change in the world of driving and it will continue to be very dangerous for everyone.

  In the article presented to me by my English teacher; there are 3 different solutions to the very detrimental and extensive problem of dirty water. The issue of dirty water has been presented and discussed continuously throughout time, but we as humans have yet to find a probable solution. The article includes 3 varying solutions that seem possible but each have their own flaws. In my personal opinion the 1st solution presents the idea of organic material filtering out harmful bacterias in the water is the most probable and accessible solution.
 
  The first solution is the best option since it is completely organic and completely safe to use. As the article states, â€œXylem consists of stacks of hollow cells. At the ends are membranes with tiny pores that prevent air bubbles from growing in size. These pores are just the right size to filter out bacteria.â€ Unlike the other solutions this one is biodegradable meaning that it will decompose easily after usage. Therefore, this is the best solution for the planet as a whole since it has no harsh chemicals, no need for sunlight, and no unnecessary metals. 
 
  You may be thinking about the other solutions and how they may differ, so I will share with you a little bit about each. The second solution requires sunlight and salt to work which may have various effects on the water. Nevertheless, the third solution which is another probable solution works 80,000 times, but it kills about 98% of germs which is in comparison to the first solution that kills nearly 100% of germs. The third solution may have a much faster way to clean water, consequently it isnâ€™t worth the risk of some germs still contaminating the water.
 
  In conclusion, the most probable solution in my opinion is the solution created by mechanical engineer, Rohit Karnik. With a safe, biodegradable, and easy to obtain substance this solution provides the best option not only for clean water but also nature itself. The other solutions present likely answers, but they donâ€™t fully tackle the problem and all the small issues that go along with it. The first solution tackles each problem with ease and originates from nature which therefore makes it the preeminent solution.

Updating or changing technology could make drivers more dangerous to pedestrians or anyone on the road, but changing attitudes could make it safer for drivers, pedestrians, or anyone on the road.

The Speedy Filter is the best way to create clean and drinkable water, it kills germs, was proven to be 98% effective in decontaminating water and it works faster than other water filters.
 The Speedy Filter is the best way to create clean water because not only does it screen out the bacteria within the water it also kills it. In the text 'Clean Water for a Dirty World' It states, ""-this time, engineers and chemists- doesn't screen out germs. Instead, it kills germs as they pass through very small carbon tubes"" This evidence shows that this product is useful for more than just screening out germs and its much safer.
 Secondly, the filter has been proven to be effective for the most part on killing bacteria, in the text it says, ""As a test, the researchers ran water contaminated with Escherichia coli bacteria through series of three of these devices, each about the size of your thumb.

This filter also kills the germs instead of capturing them. the filter doesnt get clogged because it kills the germs instead. 98% is so much better than what a lot of people are drinking now. the germs may not be 100% killed but it's a lot better than what it was. The silver wire they use isnt expensive, so it's also affordable. The silver also kills bacteria. This filter is powered by a small solar panel. The solar panel is better than having to use non-renewable energy. It is very cost effective because the solar panels are cheaper than having to use more energy.

As you may or may not know, distracted driving is becoming a huge problem in today's society. To stop distracted driving I think that society should have the danger of distracted driving be displayed more often, use the same tactics used to enforce the use of seatbelts, and enforce strict laws on distracted driving.
 
 First, if we have the dangers of distracted driving displayed more often, the social norm of distracted driving can change. People are influenced by society. If we display the dangers of distracted driving often. By often I mean all the time. Everywhere people look there are ads about distracted driving. If we do this drivers could get it stuck in their head that distracted driving is bad. If we use repetitive advertising, we can change the social norm and have good results.
 
 Second, the text states, ""Making seat belt usage mainstream relied on a combination of regulation, education, and enforcement. Curbing cell phone usage is likely to prove no different, the researchers agreed."" We can use the same tactics used to make seatbelt mainstream. Except, this time we have social media and more ways to advertise the dangers.
 
 Lastly, the text also says, â€œWe could choose not to text while driving. Companies or app companies could decide not to make it available while driving, but we donâ€™t because our culture values immediacy and access at all times,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s more profound in our decision-making than not killing the person next to us on the road.â€ I believe this is a big issue because the companies that allow drivers to text while driving arenâ€™t being punished. What they fail to realize is that they're putting someone else's life in danger when they allow drivers to use their devices while driving. To stop this we could enforce strict laws that prohibit companies from creating technology that allows drivers to use their devices while driving. Some drivers do find loopholes around the technology put in place to stop distracted driving. To stop this companies should not be allowed to launch their services if there are loopholes. Their loopholes are causing peopleâ€™s lives to be put at risk.
 
 Some might say, â€œAt the end of the day, drivers will do what they choose. This will do nothing to stop distracted driving.â€ It is true that drivers will do what they choose. However, we have to attempt to make drivers understand the dangers of distracted driving.
 
 Human beings will try to continue distracted driving, but they have to understand that someone can die because of their wrongdoing. They will be held accountable for their actions. Othersâ€™ lives and theirs can change for as long as they live. Nothing will ever be the same. They are taking a chance, playing with fire and someone can get burned. Itâ€™s best to not take the chance and just wait to send that message. So to attempt to get this into driversâ€™ heads society should have the danger of distracted driving be displayed more often, use the same tactics used to enforce the use of seatbelts, and enforce strict laws on distracted driving.

More than a million children die each year from drinking untreated water because of the diseases it can contain. Scientists have come up with multiple filters to help combat this and I believe the Speedy Filter is the best solution.
 The Speedy filter is made of very small carbon tubes, called nanotubes, topped with a mesh of very thin silver wires. One of the reasons this is a good solution is because it is not expensive, the wires are a thousand times thinner than human hair. Unlike other solutions it doesnâ€™t just screen out germs, the wire kills them off. Therefore the device doesnâ€™t get clogged and can be reused again and again. When tested, data shows that it kills 98 percent of bacteria. Now some may say that the â€œTree Provide Clue for Engineersâ€ solution is better because it traps 100 percent of bacteria compared to the Speedy Filter which kills only 98 percent. Although the other solution traps 100 percent, it also canâ€™t be reused which isnâ€™t as convenient as the Speed Filter which can be reused multiple times.

My final piece of evidence that I have found is Having this be a required field could get our drivers use to these rules and to help the dangerous situation. 
 
 These pieces of evidence prove that having a required class for driving safety would be a good thing for our drivers. My first piece of evidence shows that rather than just tip toeing around the problem, facing it head on and preventing the problem altogether will be more effective. My second piece of evidence shows that many people are not aware of driver safety and this can lead to dangerous situations giving the reason to have a drivers class. Finally my third piece of evidence shows that getting drivers into this environment could stop accidents earlier and keep our roads safe.
 
 Some people might say that taking away technology altogether will solve the problem and take away this craving for new information. Even though this is a good point, I would say that in some situations people are in need of that information and a way for people to communicate while traveling.

15687198,5/23/21,6,Butler Traditional High,Charlene Lynch,SXRZWW,Ava Milliner,NULL,"""I believe that the best invention to help the crisis of obtaining clean water is the Xylem filtration. Xylem, like said in the article was discovered by Rohit Karnik, a mechanical engineer. The way I see this invention is a natural filter that can get 100% of the bacteria out and has other benefits accessibility wise and finically wise. I see many positives to this invention and how it could put into action in the real world.
 
 One piece of evidence I have to support my invention is in the article it states,"" Xylem would provide a readily available, cheap, and biodegradable material. Of course, they ran experiments. Almost 100 percent of the test bacteria ( Escherichia Coli) were trapped!"". This piece of evidence tells me that not only is the Xylem filter inexpensive for these poorer countries, but will also be okay for the environment and will 100% provide clean water for the people of the world. i think also that it is a positive that Xylem is a natural element that is being transformed into a filter, that way there would be no chemical problems with the water. I like this idea the best because it is natural and safe for the people.
 
 Some of the other inventions are good, but there are some flaws that I want to bring up. To support my claim of the Xylem filter, I want to talk about some of the cons of the other inventions. In the article it states about the Sunlight invention,"" However SODIS doesn't work if the water is muddy."" and it also states,"" With SODIS, you put the contaminated water in a clear bottle in sunlight for six hours."". This text shows that this invention is not only time consuming, but is not one hundred percent effective in certain conditions. I feel as though you have to be thinking about what conditions the area may have and how much time the people will have to obtain water. they may not have the six hours to wait for water and might have to put out multiple bottles in a huge batch just to wait for it. This is why I feel as though that the Xylem invention would be a better option than the Sunlight option.
 
 My last final piece of evidence I want to bring up to boost my point that Xylem would be better is about the Speedy filter. In the article it states about the speedy filter that,"" As simple as these devices seem, the technical problems are complicated."". These text might not seem like a big problem because there might be problems with any of these inventions with distribution, usage and waste, but technical issues is another thing to me. In poorer countries I feel as though these problems will not be able to be immediately solved. If these technical issues can not be fixed, then this invention should not be put into play. This I feel like can not be afforded to have faults like this. The invention of the Xylem filter would not have this problem, and would not have complications like this.
 
 Overall I feel as though all these inventions could be great resolutions to these problems, but Xylem to me seems the most realistic and obtainable. Xylem will be affordable, environmentally safe, and fast working to get people clean and decontaminated water.""""",4,4,3,4,4,3,4

 I say both the people and the tech should be targeted. This because if only one of these are put into targeted, it wouldn't be able to fully solve the issue. The text says, ""current views on texting are analogous to attitudes toward seat belts in the 1980s. Making seat belt usage mainstream relied on a combination of regulation, education and enforcement. Curbing cell phone usage is likely to prove no different, the researchers agreed."" This gave me the idea that just educating drivers wouldn't be able to completely solve the problem, and using technology to regulate and limit how people could be distracted while driving, together with proper education and enforcement, could lower the amount of distracted drivers significantly.
 A counterargument towards my idea could be as David Stayer noted, drivers can often find a way around blocks put in place by the system, and find ways to use their phone even if it's prohibited. This is where the third part of the plan used in making seat belt usage mainstream can be used, which is enforcement.
 If you educate people on the subject, regulate the ways that they can become distracted, and then enforce it by giving punishments for distracted driving or being on a phone while driving, it will become more trouble than it's worth to focus on something other than driving, and the majority of people who used technology while driving would stop, thus getting rid of a majority of distracted drivers.

Almost 100 percent of the test bacteria (Escherichia coli) were trapped!"" This evidence tells you that while xylem is incredibly plentiful and very cheap, it is also very effective in trapping germs and filtering water.
 Since xylem is effective, cheap, and plentiful, it is the best option simply because a lot of people who cannot get clean water are those who are less well off, so something so easy to come by and so cheap will be the best.
 Someone may say that xylem isn't very accessible in cities due to lack of plant life, but you could still acquire it cheaply due to the sheer amount of plant life in the world. Even if there are no plants near you, you will still be able to acquire xylem to use as a filter.
 Overall, using xylem as a filter would very easily solve a lot of the problem. This is because of how cheap and plentiful it is, so while it isn't the quickest option, it is absolutely the easiest for those who lack the money to live somewhere with cleaner water, or buy cleaner water to get and use.""""",4,4,3,4,4,5,5

 I think that society should make technology where when a person gets into car they are not allowed to use their phone apps except to dial an emergency number such as 911 or a tow company. My evidence is because first, people are stubborn. Also a highway patrol man thinks technology should be the fix. You might say ""Well people should just be trustworthy and not get on their phones."" Well thats whats happening now, and look where that got us.
 
 My first reason is that people arent as trustworthy as technology sometimes. Putting in this function would eliminate 95% of accidents due to people watching their phone while drving. Obviously technology is perfect but neither are humans. People (whether they do it on purpose or not) have at some point looked at their phone while driving. And you may be thinking well it was only for a few seconds it wasnt that bad, a few seconds is all it takes for a deer to run infron of your car or for a kid to run in front of it while you driving through a neighboorhood. In the text it says, ""lasting progress will come from educating drivers and convincing them to put safety ahead of immediate access to information."" This is flawed because convincing a person might just be easier said then done.
 
 My other reason is that a proffesional highway patrol officer says that we should have the same technology in cars that we do in airplanes. In the text it says ""On the airplane, I can't talk to someone for an hour and fifteen minutes, Farrow said in an interview. When you get in the car, all this should go away"" This means that you would be physically incabable of getting to your phones apps unless the tech fails. this could lead to numbers of accidents and death due to phones go way down and become much less likely to happen.
 
 Technology has came a very long way, so I could see this happening in the near future. Personally, I think it should be a nessesaty and should be added to every car to be street legal because of my reasons which are first, some people are stubborn and untrustworthy and second a professional highway patrol worker says that this tech should be in cars. This does not only go for cars either it could be 18 wheelers or street legal dirt bikes. If you think that people can be more trustworthy then technology, you can be right but not everyone is like that sadly. Many people lie and manipulate just to get what they want which in this case could leave to lives being on the line.

In addition since the material that kills the germs (silver) is only needed in a small amount it is not expensive. This method is also stated in the text to be 80,000 times faster than other filters when electrified by a small solar panel. Combine the re-usability and the cheapness of the materials this method is incredibility affordable. In addition if you add how effective it is this method seems like the best best compared to the others.
 There isn't even a real competition between the nano-tube method and the others and I will prove why. One method that was created by Joshua Pearce and Brittany Dawney uses sunlight's heat and ultraviolet light to kill germs in a water bottle. Some people might say that this method seems better because it kills germs and seems easier to do since you only have to put a water bottle in the sun but there is more to it that you think. First you have to add salt because germs may hide among clay particles in water but salt will help the clay settle to the bottom. This process also takes six hours to kill the germs so you have to wait six hours to drink water and you can't set any bottles out to where the germs can die while you sleep because the sun isn't up.
 In addition, there is a method created by Robert Karnik where xylem from pine trees could remove bacteria from water by filtration. This method is close to beating nano-tubes, seeing that it traps 100% of bacteria while nano-tubes kill 98% but nano-tubes are more well rounded and effective.
 First, since the xylem method traps bacteria it can not be re-used often because it can clog and leave germs in the water. It is also said to be a cheap method but since you will have to keep replacing it the amount of money you have spent for clean water will grow fast unlike nano-tubes since they are reusable. Nano-tubes are also 80,000 times faster than other filtering systems and since xylem filters the water it is include in the percent that nano-tubes are faster than.
 In conclusion, nano-tubes is the best all-around method of getting clean water because it is reusable, cheap, and effective. The other methods it is compared to are great methods too but they don't beat the all-around greatness of the nano-tube method. In the future I am hoping to see even more research teams come up with ways to tackle the problem of dirty water or improve on methods that already exist. The reason for why inexpensive filters need to grow and improve is because of the the threat that dirty drinking water poses to people. For many people around the worldâ€”at least a billionâ€”there is no clean water from the tap and they have to resort to drawing their water from rivers, lakes, and even muddy holes bored into the ground, and then they drink this untreated water. This water causes more than a million children to die each year from germs that cause cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and other nasty diseases, which is why we need to stand up and help create improved versions of already great filtering methods like nano-tubes.""""",4,5,2,4,4,5,5

Punishing distracted drivers is a good way to stop them from using their phone; they are knowing the consequences so they stop doing it. For example, if we catch people playing on their phones while driving, we can make sure it goes on their permanent record. Drivers will not want to get a ticket on their permanent record, so they will turn off their phone so they donâ€™t get distracted.

The silver wires that go into this filter are cheap. This is very helpful because there are many people in this world that donâ€™t have money. This makes it easy for them to have this filter.

 This article gives a better understanding that there are many different types of solutions to fix the problem of dirty water. Having a speedy filter is the best solution for having clean water. Since this method is killing the bacteria , it doesnâ€™t get clogged. This allows the machine to be used again. We want something that isnâ€™t problematic and something that is beneficial to keeping the water clean. According to the text, â€œAs a test, the researchers ran water contaminated with Escherichia coli bacteria through a series of three of these devices, each about the size of your thumb.â€ This tells us that about 98 percent of the bacteria is clean. This is a better percentage of clean water than most countries have. Once this filter develops, it will end up being 100% of the bacteria being cleaned. We want something that cleans the water, so kids and adults donâ€™t get diseases and even be killed.
 
 The best way to help people get clean water is a speedy filter that kills germs. A speedy filter goes through a long process to kill the bacteria instead of capturing it. The filter is made out of silver and silver kills bacteria. Silver is very cheap and very beneficial to keeping water clean. This filter kills 98% of the germs. If we have this beneficial speedy filter, people we see a difference in their water. We want everyone to have clean water. This is the best way we can keep bacteria out of water. 
 
 On the other hand, some people may say that 98% of bacteria being killed isnâ€™t good enough. This point makes sense because in the article it says â€œ A test, the researchers ran water contaminated with Escherichia coli bacteria through a series of three of these devices, each about the size of your thumb. It workedâ€”98 percent of the bacteria were killed!"" This may not be good enough because there is a 2% chance that bacteria can be in the water. However, this filter goes through a long process to kill the bacteria and works 80,000 times faster than other filters.Therefore, even though there is a 2% chance that bacteria can come in the water, there is a low chance that it will happen.

There are many problems that are caused because of not having clean water. A lot of kids die from drinking water that isnâ€™t cleaned because they go and get water out of the sink when they are playing outside in a hot day. They donâ€™t know when it is cleaned or dirty. Thatâ€™s why we need a speedy filter. 
 What is a speedy filter you may ask? A speedy filter doesnâ€™t screen out germs. Instead it lets the germs pass through and will kill the germs as they pass through very small carbon tubes with mesh tops of silver wires. Whenever you have this the silver wire is as small as a human hair, so you wont be able to see it and it wont be that expensive.The speedy filter will never get clogged so you wonâ€™t have to chage it as often. The speedy filter will use a device that is a solar panel and it will clean your water 80,000 times faster than other filters. It works, 98 percent of the bacteria will get killed. That will be cleaner water for kids/adults to drink insted of dirty water that comes from river, lakes, and even muddy holes bored into the ground. If we can have the filters less kids will get sick and parents wonâ€™t have to worry about what bacteria is going into their kids body. So then they wonâ€™t have to worry about their kids getting cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and other nasty diseases. So then the percent of kids dying over untreated water will go down. 
 The speedy filter is the way to go. It is a fast cleaning filter that will kill the bacteria that is in the water. Up to 98 percent cleaner water. Itâ€™s not expensive so you wouldnâ€™t need to worry about that. If you want cleaner water I would get the speedy filter. Now I know people will say well what about the other 2 percent. You canâ€™t always get all the bacteria out of something. Some of the particles are way to small for the speedy filter to catch. But you need a little bit of dirt going into your body so you immune system stays strong so you donâ€™t get sick from other things. So after all this being said get that speedy filter and enjoy your fresh clean water.

The other options are good and efficient but if I had to select one of out of the group it would have to be the speedy filter. It was designed by a group of eight, engineers and chemist that instead of capturing germs it would kill them optimizing the resources used to make it by being a reusable product.
 
 
 The speedy filter works by letting germs pass by silver wiring that is several times more thinner than human hair, so very small, that small amount of silver is very inexpensive which could be easy to produce given enough time. That small piece of silver is enough to kill germs instead of capturing them. Killing instead of capturing germs eliminates the problem of a system like that of clogging. The device does not get clogged which means you can use it again and again as many times as you please. This is much more efficient than a normal filter that gets clogged over time and then becomes obsolete after usage.
 
 
 From the text the researches conducted several test where they passed water through their filtration system and concluded that 98 percent of the bacteria was killed. The bacteria combined with the water was Escherichia coli. The bacteria that it kills is enough to where it is safe to drink from this device. The text also claims that if powered by a small solar panel it is 80,000 times faster than other filters. Small solar polar does not produce that much energy leading to the conclusion that this device is not a energy demanding device and can work off the smallest amounts of energy and still be efficient. 
 
 
 Now many must be thinking otherwise, what if the speedy filter isn't it? There are other filtration systems that do the same job why invest more time and money into things that already exist and do the job well enough. The thing is that if we find new ways of creating filtration systems such as the speedy filter which is inexpensive it would be less costly in the near future if we decide to mass manufacture it. In the long run it will save more money and more lives than any other filtration system so it should be self evident why we should invest into newer much more efficient technology like the speedy filter.
 
 
 So after all of this I have concluded that the definitive best option is the speedy filter because not only does it work as a filtration system, instead of capturing germs it kills them. This makes the product reusable instead of clogging like other filtration devices which is already a very good quality. It works 80,000 times faster than other filtration systems and kills majority of the germs (98%) making it a very efficient device, and lastly it works off the smallest amounts of energy so it can be used very easily and it isn't that demanding.""""",5,5,2,4,4,5,5

 Have you heard about the ongoing problem of people all across the world not having clean, filtered water to drink from? This has been an issue since before you and I were born, and it has steadily been increasing as well as the death rates from dehydration and contaminated water. There are many possible solutions to this problem and each one has its downsides. The speedy filter is the best way to create clean water. It is inexpensive, it kills all the germs rather than just screening them out, and it is reusable.
 
 The speedy filter is the best way to get clean water because it is very inexpensive and can be used over and over again, which also saves the cost of having to repurchase filter options. In the text â€œClean Water for a Dirty Worldâ€ by Nancy Stamp it states, â€œThe small amount of silver is not expensive,..so it can be used over and over again.â€ Another reason why I believe that the speedy filter is the best solution is because it is inexpensive and rather than screening out the germs, it kills them all unlike some other solutions which only filter out the germs. In the passage it says, â€œ-doesnâ€™t screen out germs. Instead, it kills germs as they pass through very small carbon tubes (nanotubes) topped with a mesh of silver wiresâ€¦.Because this method is killing germs rather than capturing them, the device doesnâ€™t get clogged.â€ Lastlu, I think that the speedy filter is the best way to clean water because it works 98% of the time during trials and it works 80,00 times faster than other filters. In the text it says, â€œIt worked- 98 percent of the bacteria were killed! And by electrifying the device with a small solar panel, it is 80,000 times faster than other filters.â€ This evidence shows that the speedy filter is an inexpensive, and more efficient way of getting clean water.
 
 There are many other solutions to getting clean water as well. Others may think that the SODIS (Solar Water Disinfection) is better because all you have to do is sit it in a water bottle and leave it in the sun for six hours. However my claim is the best because it is much faster and less time consuming and it works with all times of water while the SODIS method only works with clear water unless you use salt so that the clay will sink to the bottom and then it can be filtered.

To combat this, more than education will be needed to convince people to stop driving while distracted. This has been proven in the past. Just a few decades ago in the 80's, seatbelts were not being worn as much as they needed to be. Researchers had agreed that to increase seat belt usage, there needed to be stronger enforcement; regulation; and education. To decrease cell phone usage, it will need those exact things according to researchers.
 Education can be a vital step in decreasing distracted driving. If people were told about the dangers that are caused by not paying attention, it would curb distracted driving. It has been proven in the past that education wouldn't be the only step necsessary. Regulation would be important because it would put stricter laws in place. Enforcement would make sure these laws are being followed so everyone stays safe. With these three steps, the numbers of crashes would go down significantly.
 I know that an argument would be that technology needs to change as well, but people have often found ways around barriers put in place to stop distracted driving. Whenever something is so heavily influenced by the public like always being accessible, people will risk their safety just to post something. Nic Ward (a professor at Montana State University) said ""Societal influences have always pushed bad behavior, even if you have good technology."" Even if a vehicle had features that would disable phones, people would find ways around it just to stay connected. Instead of putting the phone down for a few minutes, people would rather risk their lives, as well as put others in danger.

This issue affects at least a billion people on Earth. Scientists, engineers, and chemists have been trying to create more affordable options to combat this growing issue. The best way to create clean, drinkable water is by the mechanical engineer Rohit Karnik.
 Rohit Karnik's idea is the best way to counteract this problem because it is completely centered around plants. The whole basis of the design is on the structure of plants, specifically the water channels known as xylem. The xylem found in pine trees have pores that are the perfect size to filter bacteria. Even though this method might not be as fast as other solutions, it is more effective. The xylem filtration has shown to be 100% effective in trapping the test bacteria. Besides being one of the most efficient filters, it is cheap to produce as well as biodegradable. 
 I understand that some people may be hesitant to accept this idea since Rohit Karnik is a mechanical engineer - not a scientist, but his concept was formed by listening to scientists. He had heard a group of scientists discussing how plants transport water from the roots to the leaves. That's how Karnik and his team of engineers were able to discover that xylem could filter bacteria. Even if you still are doubtful about his credibility, the results don't lie.

 Firstly, we have to punish distracted drivers. I think the reasoning behind this one is pretty obvious. You're more likely to stop doing something of there is a consequence such as a fine or etc. If you have distracted drivers knowing since the beginning that there is consequences then there are more likely to follow them.

What i mean by this is that it is way easier to educate the driver on the dangers of distracted driving than trying to convince companies to disable their apps while the consumer is driving.

 The Second reason why I think that speedy filter is a good choice to clean water is that it is something that can be used repeatedly over and over again without getting clogged up with bacteria like a normal water filter so you don't have to replace it often.
 The Third reason is that it is very affordable and is efficient. the materials used for this speedy filter are not expensive and don't require much effort to make.
 Cleaning with sunlight is also a way to clean water as well. All though SODIS is a very easy 
  way to clean water it also has disadvantages, They kill most germs without us knowing if it is all gone and in order for it to clean thoroughly you need salt to get rid of the thing that make the water murky and harder to clean. not only does the speedy filter capture germs and bacteria, it kills them as well unlike some filters that just capture them. 
 So think of what you would do if that water you sip on after a hard day at work wasnt clean and what you would do to clean it. """"",2,3,2,3,2,4,4

Its the fastest filter and instead of trapping the germs and the mesh getting clogged it kills them by using a small amount of inexpensive silver. Its also 80,000 times faster than the other filters and when tested killed 98 percent of the bacteria.
 
 One reason I think the speedy filter is the best option is because it is reusable and will never get clogged, a lot of people don't have the money to keep rebuying a filter to keep their water clean so this product can prevent that from happening. Instead of just capturing the germs it uses a small amount of inexpensive silver to kill them and prevent the filter from getting clogged.
 
 Researchers ran a test on the filter where they ran e-coli infested water through it to see how effective it is and it cleared 98 percent of the e-coli out of the water. Since it works with a solar panel it makes it 80,000 times faster than the other filters.
 
  Even though people might say tree filter is better because it captured 100% of the bacteria eventually the bacteriaâ€™s going to build up and eventually get clogged up and your going to have to buy another one costing you a lot of money eventually that you Could of save by buying the faster one that doesnâ€™t clog up
 
 The speedy filter is a better option for many reasons it doesnâ€™t clog up because of the silver used meaning your not going to have to buy multiple. Itâ€™s also 80000 times faster than competing filters making it the best option out of the rest.

The fact that groups of people care about others enough to try and find a solution. Honestly every single one of these ideas is a solid plan and is thoroughly researched. One with the hollow tubes which filter out the bacteria made within trees, one with a method of SODIS which is solar water disinfection because after studying, six hours in sunlight can kill the germs in the water. But the method I see as the most effective and most fit to provide clean drinking water is the Speedy filter with carbon tubes and silver wiring.
 
 This plan honestly seems like the most inexpensive and effective solution in my opinion. The nanotubes(carbon tubes) topped with a mesh of silver wires kills germs rather than capturing them. The small amount of silver used in the particular solution is not expensive, and the silver kills bacteria. This device also would not get clogged providing safer and more effective transactions. â€œ The wire is a thousand times thinner than a human hair.â€ With the wire being so incredibly thin, inexpensive and small this would be an incredible solution to go with. â€œ It workedâ€”98 percent of the bacteria were killed! â€œ It also works to kill nearly 100% of germs. So 9/10 times almost 10/10 times this will be effective and safe as well as inexpensive. And it is also a reusable method that is 80,000 times faster than other filters.
 
 Others may disagree that the fact of this is the best solution. Like the SODIS method or perhaps the Xylem method. However the Xylem method does not kill germs like the nanotubes method does instead it traps it. However I could see why people would choose this method over the speedy filter due to the fact that it does in fact trap 100% of the germs. But, it does not kill them like the speedy filter does. The SODIS method reminds me of people who boil salt water to make it drinkable. Essentially it is sunlight filtering and cooking these germs out of the water. However with this method if the dirty water is muddy it will not work. In my opinion, overall the nanotubes are the best option. Itâ€™s fast, safe, effective and inexpensive and is the best way to filter dirty water.

It became normal for people to shoot a quick text or glance at their phones while behind the wheel. Is there really a solution behind the ignorance of distracted driving? Yes: Education and Enforcement is needed to keep people focused on the road. 
 According to edgarsnyder.com, The National Safety Council reports that cellphone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes a year! About 390,000 of those are caused by texting while driving. This makes sense, considering that while looking at your phone, you aren't even able to look at the road to focus on it. You won't be able to see what cars swerve in front of you or what traffic signs are ahead. 
 Now we see how dangerous texting and driving, but how can enforcement and education possibly fix that? During a panel at the Governors Highway Safety Association, researchers suggested that â€œLasting progress will come from educating drivers and convincing them to put safety ahead of immediate access to information."" Spreading the word and explaining to people how dangerous it is to be distracted while driving could help them to see how serious the issue is, just like it did with seat belts.
 So what about the ""enforcement?"" According to the Governors Highway Safety Association, Many states passed laws that address phone usage while driving. If a lot of states already passed laws addressing the need to stay focused on the road, then what are the other states waiting for? They should come up with the same laws as well. 
 There are a lot of experienced drivers out there who may be thinking, ""Iâ€™m good at multi-tasking, Iâ€™ll be fine!"" While you may be good at multi-tasking, this shouldn't be applied to the road. When you're on the road, you should focus on your surroundings such as other cars or traffic signs. You won't be able to see what cars swerve in front of you or what traffic signs and warnings are ahead if you're looking at your phone.
 To conclude, distracted driving is extremely dangerous. If everyone comes together to enforce and educate the need to stay focused on the road, driving will be a lot safer. How will your family react if you put yourself and others in danger by being distracted on the road? Think about that next time you respond to a text message while behind the wheel.""""",4,5,5,4,4,5,5

 First, the filter is inexpensive. This wire uses very small carbon tubes topped with silver wires. ""The wire is a thousand times thinner that a human hair."" This means only a very small amount of silver is used, making it very cheap. This is perfect for people who can't afford expensive filters.

We should think about others and ourselves so we donâ€™t kill the person next to us. 
 ""Technological solutions, such as limiting texting via car infotainment systems, often do little to correct bad driving habits, added David Stayer, a professor in the University of Utah's Department of Psychology. Stayer noted that drivers will often find ways around blocks their systems put in place, using their phone even if their in-car system prohibits it.""

When drivers decide for themselves and think of driving as being on a plane that can help a whole lot because while you are on a plane you are thinking of others not just yourself because not being on your phone helps with not messing with the flight. I do understand it is a lot to ask for and will take time to adjust but if we all work together and think about one of your family members on the road we could all really make a difference.

Now for the sunlight. This one was just the worst one to me so far. I guess the pros of this is that sunlight kills off germs but that just isn't even good reasoning. The cons are that it takes six hours for it to work. Most times people want or need water then not have to wait six hours and then if the water is muddy they have to add salt. They also did not do any test to see what percentage of germs it kills off. Like i get it is cheap but this invention is just not reasonable to me.

I know that some cars have a setting where you can get the text messages on the car and the car will read them aloud but humans still get on their phone to respond or read it again. So the technology is kind of pointless.
  â€œOn the airplane, I canâ€™t talk to someone for an hour and fifteen minutes,â€ Farrow said in an interview. â€œWhen you get in the car, all this should go away.â€ The article states that when you tell someone you're going on an airplane they wonâ€™t text you until you get off. This could be the same way with driving. There should be a driver mode like there is an airplane mode.
  There are many ways we may be able to change a human's mindset about texting and driving but I think one, in particular, is giving them class. you're probably thinking that classes aren't going to help and the humans won't pay attention. I think if we make the classes interesting enough then they will. For example, if we tell them the percentage of people who have died texting and driving then maybe that will change their mind because they don't want to risk their life or someone else. 
  Some people might say that humans aren't going to listen to what they say and humans can do what they want versus technology is programmed to do the right thing and stop distracted drivers. Although I see where they are coming from, technology has been changed and programmed to stop distracted drivers and it hasnâ€™t worked. The least we could do to prevent this problem is to go at it from a different perspective. That is why we are going to try to change the human mindset.

Over 2.1 billion, which is 29% of the world, does not have access to clean safe water. â€œSpeed Filtersâ€ are fast, they kill germs, and they are not expensive.
 
 One of the benefits of the â€œSpeed Filtersâ€ is they work fast. For example the â€œSunlight Cooks Germsâ€ takes up to six hours to clean the water and it is in small increments of water. When using the speed filters it is proven that they can work 80,000 times faster. They work so fast because they are getting the energy and electricity they need from a small solar panel. This is a great way to save the environment too by using natural light to run these filters. 
 
 Another benefit is that they kill the germs. â€œSpeedy Filtersâ€ are designed to kill the germs instead of trapping them which can cause the system to clog. These filters are using silver, which silver kills bacteria. Since they are not getting clogged with the bacteria they are able to be used again. That is another plus that saves resources when it is reusable. 
 
 Some people may say that the â€œTrees Provide Clues for Engineersâ€ system is better because they use natural resources from the leaves and it is biodegradable. Although that is great, being natural â€œSpeedy Filtersâ€ is more accurate. In the trees provide clues for engineers they trap the germs which could potentially get clogged and some bacteria can leak through and harm the person drinking the water. 
 
 As you can see scientists and engineers are in the right direction to helping poorer countries have clean safe water. Unclean water has affected about 29% of the world due to not having the right filters systems to clean the water. These scientists are not only helping America but other countries around the world.

People are aware that driving distracted is not safe, yet they still continue to do so. Technology companies may provide cars with advanced systems, but these systems are supposed to encourage drivers to use them hands off, and keep their hands on the wheel, and eyes on the road. Drivers are the ones misusing these technology systems, by not being fully aware of how they work before turning on the car and driving to their next location. Drivers are the ones to blame, not the technology companies. 
 
 One reasons drivers are too blame, is that drivers easily allow themselves to misuse the technology provided to them. For example, car companies are adding voice activated systems that calls for no use of touching a smartphone. A simple button on the steering wheel activates the system, and once asked for a response, the driver can give commands to the system, that allows them to stay focused on the road in the process. A driver can simply say ""Call (Contact Name)"" and the system will send the information to the drivers smartphone, and through a Bluetooth connection, the driver can talk to a contact through their radio system. This is a great way to not get distracted while driving, yet drivers don't use it. 
 
 I'm aware not all cars have this option, but many smartphones have available applications that can help a driver not get distracted at the wheel. For example, iPhones allow an user to put their phone on ""Do Not Disturb Mode"". This mode can be turned an manually, but theirs also options to use it. Drivers can have their phone be set up to where, once they start driving, their phone will automatically silence any notification. During this time, the phone can send a default message that tells the contact trying to contact the driver that they are currently driving. Understandably, emergencies can happen. So, an user can set it up to where a contact calls back to back, the second call will be announced to the driver. 
 
 Drivers main area of distraction comes from texting and driving. Although their are many options to eliminate the chance of using a smartphone while operating a vehicle, drivers choose to ignore them, and keep pushing towards unsafe driving habits. Car companies are providing many options to keep drivers focused on the road, and not on their phones. Phone companies also provide these options built into their devices. 
 
 Some may argue that too much technology in the car is the problem, because it allows the driver access to all the things that distract them. They may also say that drivers can just appropriately use the block distracted driving options, and that will simply solve the issue. Although I wish that this was the truth, researcher David Stayer stated that technological solutions do not always solve the issue with drivers using their cell phones at the wheel. If a driver wants to use their phone, they will somehow find ways around block systems to prohibit them from using them. The best solution to the problem lays within the driver, they just should keep technology use to limited times, while in the process of driving.
 
 When it comes to choosing whether or not to use a cellphone at the wheel, it's the drivers choice. Technology companies and car companies are trying to eliminate the number of distracted drivers, not increase them. By offering many solutions to the problem, these companies are hoping users use their products correctly. They should not be to blame when a user misuses their products. The driver is in complete control, therefore they are the ones to blame.""""",4,5,3,4,4,5,5

With this solution, it kills the germs instead of trapping them, and it works about 80,000 times faster than the other methods developed. It is environment friendly, affordable, reusable and most of all, effective. 
 Unlike other ways to solve the lack of clean water in poorer countries, this method kills the bacteria found in dirty water, instead of trapping it. When trapping the bacteria, the bacteria can get clogged onto filters, and make water unsafe to drink. But, this method has the opposite effect. By killing about 98% of the germs and bacteria found in water, this method provides a safe and easy way to drink safe water. This also makes the product reusable, because by killing the germs compared to capturing them, bacteria won't become clogged. I know this because in the next, it states ""It workedâ€”98 percent of the bacteria were killed!"" This proves that this method is effective. 
 This method is also affordable. The silver used to create this is thinner than a strand of human hair, making this silver cheap and accessible for poorer countries. In the text, it states, ""That small amount of silver is not expensive.."" The method also doesn't require strong electricity or other methods poorer countries may not have access to, because its powered by solar panels. 
 Some may say the SODIS method or the Xylem method works better, but this isn't correct. The SODIS method will be using bottles, sunlight and salt to cook away germs. Although the idea of this seems effective, the amount of clear bottles it will take to provide enough water for everyone is a lot, and if there is no salt, it doesn't even work on muddy water. The Xylem method does kill 100% of the germs and is environmentally friendly, but you would have to keep purchasing and remaking the product. It also traps germs instead of killing them, leaving risk of bacteria build up in water. With the nanotubes method, you have a cheap, environmentally friendly and reusable way to clean water. 
 In conclusion, the nanotubes method is the best and most effective way to get clean, and affordable, water quickly.""""",4,4,3,4,4,5,5

When taking your drivers test, requiring a class/lesson about distracted driving and how it can affect people around you could prevent distracted driving.
 For example in the text it says, â€œRather than focus on how technology can get around or force a behavior, Iâ€™d like to move further downstream and find ways for people to make the right decision beforehand.â€ Making the right decisions is more effective than forcing â€œgoodâ€ behavior on people because if you are educated then you can teach other people the reasons why being distracted while driving is bad. If they do decide to still use technology while driving then it still gives them the option to learn from their mistakes. The way that most of society looks at distracted driving is that they know it can be dangerous however they donâ€™t think itâ€™s a big deal until something bad actually happens. Learning from mistakes that you make will bring you the realization of things like â€œI can't believe I did thatâ€ or â€œI will never do that again because now I know how bad it actually isâ€ etc. One of the best ways to learn is from mistakes because it will stay with you forever. Taking a class when you take your drivers test about distracted driving and how effective it is, is similar to school and how you learn and you take what you learn and use it in life. When they learn about how effective distracted driving is then they more than likely will take it and use it when driving. 
 In conclusion, distracted driving is very dangerous and if you were required to take a class about it then it could prevent it and educate the young before they go on the road. Someone may say that they could still participate in distracted driving even though they are â€œeducatedâ€ so they should just shut down technology when driving, however forcing a behavior on someone will never give them a chance to learn or understand how it is wrong.

In order to help get clean water, the best way to do so is with the speedy filter invention because it is fast, cheap and can be used multiple times. This allows more people to have clean water. 
 
 Reason one, the speedy filter process is fast. In the text it states â€œit is 80,000 times faster than other filters."" Meaning it can make more water clean because it's able to filter it faster, this makes it more effective. This one is faster than others because the device is electrified with a small solar panel. The â€œSunlight Cooks Germsâ€ filter takes about 6 hours to kill the germs meaning that the speedy filter must be very fast and take little time to go into effect.
 
 Another reason is that this filter can be used multiple times. Since this filter method is killing the germs it isn't possible for the device to get clogged therefore it can be used more than once. The â€œTrees Provide Clue for Engineersâ€ filter has a chance of getting clogged since that method traps the bacteria by using filtration, rather than killing it. This results in that filter not being able to be used multiple times unlike the speedy filter.
 
 Lastly, the speedy filter is the best alternative because it's inexpensive. The germs get killed as they pass through very thin carbon tubes that have a mesh of silver wires. Both the thin carbon tubes and the little amount of silver needed are cheap. Since the filter can be used multiple times it supports that it won't cost much because not a lot of material will be needed.
 
 Counterclaim: I understand how with the â€œTrees Provide Clue for Engineersâ€ filter, almost 100 percent of the bacteria was trapped; however, with the speedy filter the germs are completely killed. It is better if they are completely destroyed because the bacteria can make you very sick. 
 In conclusion, the speedy filter is the better choice for clean water. The speedy filter is fast, inexpensive, and can be used multiple times. Therefore, it is the best invention. As it is simple and fast this makes it a good way to filter out the water.

 My reasoning for picking speedy filter as the ones with the best inventions to help get clean water is because one it kills 98% of bacteria which is good because they don't just capture it they kill it & that's good because u shouldn't just have bacteria just sitting because it could get worse and just start spreading & causing even more problems than what it already causes.The method that their using also doesn't get clogged & is 80,000 times faster than other filters this is good because we need all bacteria/germs to be killed as easy and quick as possible so that its not causing any problems and so the water can be much cleaner for people to have.It getting clogged would cause an pause in getting clean water as quick as possible that most people need it.
 
 Some people may think that the speedy trial isn't the best idea or invention that has been made up/thought of and they may also feel like their solution may not really be a help to get clean water but,here's why their would be the best because none of the others one really mentioned how fast their invention would work to help get clean water like speedy trial mentioned that it does not get clogged which means there wouldn't be a stop in something from getting the clean water where in the other inventions they didn't mention any possible affects that could stop the clean water from getting to how its supposed to be.
 
 In conclusion the speedy filter would be the best invention to help people get clean water because it is an quick and easy way and their invention not just captures the bacteria/germs but it kills them so that it doesn't effect anything or anybody because it can harm many people especially if they don't have the clean water that they need.

 This piece of evidence supports my claim because all the bacteria in the dirty will get killed. The device not being able to get clogged is a good benefit as well. The filter can also be used again and again. This way, it will be cheaper without having to replace clogged filters frequently. Who knows, maybe if it only captured germs, some of it could be still in the water. Or be released into the water depending on how clogged it gets.
 The text also states, ""The wire is a thousand times thinner than a human hair. That small amount of silver is not expensive.""

Possibly in the future, they can advance the filter to kill 100 percent of the bacteria. How rapid the filter makes the water clean is another good benefit as well.
 Although, it could get expensive with how many filters they may need and to use the silver. Expenses can add up. Also, you have to think about how there may be problems that appear with the filter, like technical problems (as said in the article). Anything can happen. There also could be some people who don't agree how the filter doesn't 100 percent kill the bacteria. For example, the tree filter almost caught 100 percent of the bacteria. 
 Either way, research teams can always do more research or find ways to advance this filter in case if some problems do occur. 
 In my opinion, I don't believe that the tree invention, or the sunlight cooking germs invention will be the best way. 
 I say this because, when using the tree method, what if there is an area that doesn't have many trees around them to use as filters? The explanation of the invention did not make much sense of me either. I believe it was more complicated, and that the best invention should be simple.

This method would work because of how the plants transfer water form their roots to the leaves. The plants depend on evaporation to get the water up to the leaves so, this would be useful because with evaporation the xylem, water molecules in the plants' water channels, is pulled upwards. if some air bubbles were to form in the plants channel, the plant would stop the water flow. In the membrane there are tiny pores at the end. these pores would become useful to filter the bacteria out of the water.

 -Im not sure if we were supposed to resumbit this essay I wrote before, or the new one I wrote on my document, so heres both.
 
 
 The laws against distracted driving should be better enforced to make sure people are staying off their devices while on the road. You probably donâ€™t think being on your phone or other device is that bad, but just listen. When you are driving with your phone in hand, then you are not only putting yourself in danger, you're putting everyone on the road in danger as well. Imagine you glance at your phone, but what you donâ€™t see is a little Toyota Camry had to swerve into your lane because someone pulled out in front of them. You arenâ€™t aware because in that second you were looking at your phone, and you slam into the back of them causing both of you to spin out of control. You just severely injured a mom and her 5 year old son, because you wanted to look at your phone while you were driving. 
 Ok so how would enforcing laws against distracted driving help the issue? 
 You would be stopping any harm before it happens.
 Youâ€™d keep people from being on their phones in the first place in fear of getting a ticket or fine.
 According to evidence from the article above and past experiences, â€œMaking seat belt usage mainstream relied on a combination of regulation, education and enforcement. Curbing cell phone usage is likely to prove no different, the researchers agreed.â€ This is saying that to ensure people wore their seat belts they had to regulate, and enforce wearing your seatbelt. We can do the same things with distracted driving.
 Now I understand that enforcing laws against distracted driving isnâ€™t going to work a hundred percent, take seat belts as an example again. Not everyone wears their seatbelt, but the majority of people do and that saves many lives.

   Now if you look at the second option, this is a very easy and affordable idea. Everyone has access to the sun, and if people could get shipments of salt to use to separate the clay, it would be a very smart route.

I think this because the other two inventions would take a while to accomplish something, but this one works faster. The Speedy Filter is the best invention because it also kills the germs instead of just capturing them. This filter will also never get clogged since it kills the germs. In the text, it says ""And by electrifying the device with a small solar panel, it is 80,000 times faster than the other filters.â€ ""Because this method is killing germs rather than capturing them, the device doesn't get clogged."" These pieces of evidence support my answer because the author is telling you by doing one task, it can make this filter work faster than other filters and it explains in more detail why the filter won't get clogged. Others may think that the Solar Water Disinfection is better because it uses natural sunlight. On the other hand, using natural sunlight would take longer and you would have to wait. However, my claim is the best because not having to wait to drink clean water would be better and it would allow you not to still have tiny germs that you canâ€™t see.

Three ways I believe that is important would be because of social influences, technology errors, and learn things on your own. So in this essay I will be explaining all reasonings and how they could be helpful if they were discussed in an appropriate manner.
  So my first reasoning that I am discussing would be because of the negative influences. When saying that I mean that our media/ people today really promote things that might not always be the best idea. So for today's instant I'm talking about safe driving. The quote that I chose to back up my reasoning would be "", You canâ€™t really talk about distraction and technology without considering the social context in which it happens because the social influences have always pushed bad behavior, even if you have good technology."" I chose this quote because I really feel as if it really explains that people/ things we may look up to could possibly be preventing negative activities. For example I see a lot of youtubers driving while doing other activities. Therefore possibly making it seem like those things are ok. So maybe what others could do would be letting others out there know that is not normal and also not ok.
  My second reasoning would be technology errors. Now when I say technical errors i don't mean like the car doesn't function or anything. What i mean is sometimes the system really does not make is some what known that their is some driving is not in the safest way. The quote from the text to back this reasoning up would be "", Technological solutions, such as limiting texting via car infotainment systems, often do little to correct bad driving habits."" What this basically says is these car systems do very little to correct misguided behavior.
  My last reasoning would be learning out to be informed on your own. I say that because i feel as if we as people depend on these car systems to be able to correct or adjust us when we are having faulty driving moments. That why i say that we need to learn how to be able to correct ourselves when it comes to those driving habits. 
  I hope today in my essay you understood why i am pushing for safe driving should not always be approached from the same angle, but different ones. That's why it is important to know where these negative behavior come from different ways.

When reading the article, i read all three of the ideas, but this one just seems like it'll do the most and it'll be most beneficial. I say that because it seems inexpensive, natural, and seems most reliable. So in these next three paragraphs i will be explaining my reasoning in more detail. 
 Some my first reasoning to my claim would be this invention seems the most inexpensive. I say that because the overall concept of this invention would be all coming from a plant. What i mean by this would be people all over the world are already struggling as it is to get water, so 9/10 they do not have the financial stability to get all of these expensive filters. For example in the text it says,In richer countries, water is made safe to drink by filtration, chlorination, boiling, and/or treatment with ultraviolet light. In poorer countries, these methods may be out of reach based on the price. For example, boiling requires fuel, and families may have only enough fuel to cook their food. Cheap filters for home use are probably the best solution. However, filters get clogged with bacteria. "" Meaning these people are having to use the not safest ways to get clean drinking water. So with this invention it gives these people reasonable resources to do what they need to do.
 My second piece of reasoning would be how natural it will be. I say that this invention is quite natural because like I've stated previously, this all comes from plants/ tress. I believe that with this product being natural, it could be easier for people around the world the water that they need in that moment like sinks. A piece of evidence for my reasoning would be,The idea came to Rohit Karnik, a mechanical engineer, when he was listening to scientists talk about how plants transport water from their roots to the leaves. Plants donâ€™t pump water up to the leaves. Instead, the plants rely on evaporation of water from the leaves through their stomata."" This shows that this invention of the process of water can be very environmental friendly and also very easy for others to use.
 My last piece of reasoning would be this invention seems more reliable. i say that because the plants only rely on evaporation of water from leaves. Without evaporation the molecules water channels (the xylem) are pulled upward. Therefore is goes through this whole natural system which all together filters out the bacteria. i know this because the article says,"" With evaporation, water molecules in the plantsâ€™ water channelsâ€”the xylemâ€”are pulled upward. The pull is similar to your sucking up water through a straw. If air bubbles were to build up in a plantâ€™s water channels, the bubbles would block the flow of water."" These pores are just the right size to filter out bacteria. So Karnikâ€™s team of engineers guessed that xylem from pine trees could remove bacteria from water by filtration. Xylem would provide a readily available, cheap, and biodegradable material. Of course, they ran experiments. Almost 100 percent of the test bacteria (Escherichia coli) were trapped!""
 In conclusion i say the trees provide clue for egineers experiment/ invention is the best one because it is natural which is actually helping the envirnment, inexpensive for thoes who can't afford a system for clean water, and most reliable. i think that with this invention it can go a long way with thoes behind in the worlds water system.

All three solutions do remove or capture the germs and bacteria but the speedy filter kills them. When I drink water I would want the bacteria to be killed not just removed and this is why I believe that the speedy filter is the best one. 
 
 Not only does the speedy filter kill bacteria it works faster. In the article it states ""And by electrifying the device with a small solar panel, it is 80,000 times faster than other filters."" As with the ""Sunlight Cooks Germs"" it takes longer to remove and kill the germs. In the article it says ""Then six hours in sunlight can kill off the germs in the water"". Plus this solution is difficult because this method doesn't work if the water is muddy. The germs can hide among clay particles in murky water. Then the other solution ""Trees Provide Clue for Engineers"" Karnik's team of engineers guessed xylem (consists of stacks of hollow cells,at the ends are membranes with tiny pores which are the right size to filter out bacteria.) from pine trees could remove bacteria from water by filtration. The article doesn't tell me about how long it takes it work but I would say this would be the second best option. 
 
 Although the speedy filter only kills about 98 percent of the bacteria,The small amount of silver used is not expensive and the silver kills the bacteria. This method is killing the germs rather than capturing then, the device doesn't get clogged. It can be used again and again. Also by electrifying the device with a small solar panel, it is 80,000 times faster than other filters.

My mom was turning to go get Chick-Fil-A and I was looking out the window and all of a sudden I see a car going about 55 miles per hour and she t-bones my moms car on my side. We found out that she wasn't paying attention and was on her phone. Our car almost flipped and I passed out because I smacked my head on the window, I had a grade 3 concussion.

We must shift these norms if we are going to fix distracted driving.

This is why we need education campaigns; distracted driving will not be fixed if we donâ€™t start convincing drivers to put their safety ahead of them rather than worrying about immediate access to internet. There will be consequences that we are going to regret and live with our entire life if we dont start somewhere. Now, if we know better, we do better. Meaning that if we continue to educate people, they will slowly learn better habits and begin to do better, which is exactly the kind of cultural shift we need. On the contrary, many people already know this is dangerous but they still continue to do it. I know that many people already know this is dangerous but if we can shift younger people's mindset about phone usage and just being distracted in the car, then that would make a big difference.

Scientist and engineers are trying to find affordable solutions to clean water, and the best solution to me is the ""speedy filter"". 
 The speedy filter is a method that kills germs rather than screening them out. It uses tiny carbon tubes topped with a mesh of silver wires; the silver is not expensive and it kills the bacteria without the device getting clogged.

 On the contrary, people might say the ""Sunlight Cooks Germs"" method is the best because it also kills germs instead of filtering them out. Yes, I can see why people might say this method is the best, but in reality the ""speedy filter"" is the best.

The driver and the car brands are at fault here, although the driver is making the choice to pick up their phone while driving car companies are attracting their customer with ways to use their technology while driving. The driver should become more educated on how dangerous distracted driving can be, in order to help reduce the amount of distracted driving that happens. Car companies need to stop using technology to help sell their cars. For example a lot of cars have a screen that can connect to your phone allowing it to be a touch away, this can make texting a lot easier to do which is more dangerous. Drivers becoming more educated allows them to know the risks of distracted driving and might be able to help it stop. Even if car companies stop promoting technology and even put limits on how much someone can use their phone while driving it won't completely stop distracted driving, there will still be people who find away around it.

To some people getting just clean water, not even cold water is super difficult. Many people struggle to find clean water for their kids to drink. More than a million kids die a year from drinking dirty, and contaminated water. Luckily there have been things created at a sufficient price that could help reduce this number. The speedy filter is the best way to create clean water. The speedy filter doesnâ€™t just capture the germs from the contaminated water but kills the germs, this allows it to get used more than once. All it uses is a small thin piece of silver wire that is not super pricey.
  The speedy filter is the best way to get clean water because it is cost efficient and has worked 80,000 times faster than other filters. This filter is made up of a small amount of silver that is inexpensive which is always a plus. It is especially a plus in this case because the cheaper and more effective the better. While the piece of silver might seem small and useless it actually kills the bacteria that is in the water making it safe to drink. Since the filter kills the bacteria instead of just capturing it it allows this device to be used more than once. This tiny piece of silver can kill the bacteria and not get clogged while in that process, thatâ€™s impressive. When this device got put to the test it killed 98% of the bacteria in the contaminated water. Comparing this to what the other devices do and cost, the speedy filter has checked off all the right boxes.
  While some people think that the other devices might be better since one only uses salt and sunlight, while the speedy filter uses silver the outcome of the speedy filter is so much more effective. Salt and sunlight would most likely come a lot easier to people than the piece of silver but the silver has the ability to remove 98% of the bacteria in the contaminated water. The speedy filter also works 80,000 themes faster than most other filters, the salt and sun method can take up to 6 hours. While the silver might cost a bit more than the salt it works faster and can almost guarantee you clean water. Since the sun and salt method has two main components missing, one can completely ruin the whole purpose. If the sun is not out the salt won't get activated to kill or capture the bacteria in the contaminated water. With the filter it is super thin and small having the ability to be used over and over again.
  Having clean drinking water is a privilege that many people might not realize, many of us take it for granted as well. There have been many test runs and experiments done to help find a way to efficiently and effectively clean water for those who need it. A big factor that played into finding the best one is the cost of each thing needed. The speedy filter is cost efficient and has the ability to be used more than once, while not just taking the bacteria out of the contaminated water but killing it. This filter option has many good features that you might not get from the other water cleaning devices.

Distracted driving has caused our roads to be extremely unsafe these days. This problem definitely needs a solution, it's just a matter of how can we solve this. The problem with distracted driving is that it is so widespread. At this point, the only way to fix any of it is to approach it from from several different angles. For example, we should upgrade the tech in cars, educate drivers about the effects of distracted driving, and create a fine, or law that would make people want to steer clear of distracted driving. 
 
 One of the angles we need to approach would be to encourage tech companies to make all apps in accessible while driving. Doing this would help to reduce distracted driving because it would take the ability to be on your phone, or interact with the screen in the car, away from all drivers. This would force drivers to focus on the road by giving them nothing better to do. 
  
 Another angle would be approaching it with the drivers. Wen need to educate our drivers on the effects of distracted driving because for some of them, upgrading technology simply just isn't enough. If they feel the overwhelming need to drive distracted, they will find a way around it. For some drivers, a face to face wake up call is perfect for them. 
 
 The last angle would be making it illegal. Distracted driving can be just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than drinking and driving. It can be even more dangerous because you think you are in complete control, but you're not. I think that distracted driving should have its own DUI type thing. You might think that is a little harsh, but making it the big deal it should be will go a long way to help solve this problem.
 
 Some might say that distracted driving isn't an issue, but these people haven't been affected by distracted driving. Statistics say that 1 in every 4 accidents are caused by texting and driving alone. This doesn't even include any other forms of distracted driving such as eating, doing your makeup, etc. 
 
 In conclusion, we know that distracted driving is bad, and it needs to be solved. It has caused our roads to be extremely unsafe. A few ways to solve the issue of distracted driving would be restricting access to apps and installations while driving, educating drivers on the effects d distracted driving, and making it illegal.

Rohit Karnik got his idea/concept from trees themselves. Joshua Pearce and Brittany Dawney used the ultra violet and heat rays from the sun to kill most germs. Another team is using nanotubes. Obviously this issue needs a solution, but the question is, which one?
 
 The ""Speedy Filter"" would be the best filter for the job. I feel this way because its the fastest, most reusable, and kills 98% of all bacteria and germs. This filter uses very small carbon tubes called nanotubes, and a mesh of extremely thin silver wire that will kill bacteria as the water passes through. This filter doesn't just capture germs, it kills them. Because of this, the speedy filter can be reused a countless amount of times. 
 
 In comparison to the filter that Rohit Karnik came up with, you can see that the speedy filter is overall jut better. Karniks idea would work; however, because it only traps bacteria and germs, it wouldn't be a long term solution. Sure it's cheap now, but when you have to buy filter after filter, it's going to add up. Karniks filter would also take a lot more time than the speedy filter. 
 
 When you compare the speedy filter with the concept that Joshua Pearce and Brittany Dawney constructed, you can see that, once again, the speedy filter is overall a better solution to the issue at hand.

With that said the speedy filter is 80,000 times faster and is more effective than SODIS, and works with water no matter exactly how contaminated it is.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Do you like water? Do you like clean water? A lot of people drink water everyday, but not all of them have access to clean water like some of us do. This is why we should use the Speedy Filter to help those who need clean water.
 
 The Speedy Filter is the best option for helping people get clean water because it meets a lot of the requirements that you need for clean drinking water. Test runs of the Speedy Filter have shown that it killed 98 percent of bacteria instead of just filtering it out. The Speedy Filter is also very fast when its cleaning the water, you don't want it to take all day to be able to get clean water, you want that water right away. The Speedy Filter also uses minimal resources therefore its easy to afford for people struggling with money.
 
 The Speedy Filter has a lot more pros than the other two. In the experiment with trees being able to trap the bacteria, its very complex and confusing to understand as to how it works. Unless you are really trying to figure it out. With the experiment on the sunlight cooking the germs it only works most efficiently when the water is clear, if its muddy it doesnt work. It also takes up to SIX hours to kill off the germs, and im sure the tree took just as long or longer. The Speedy Filter has solar panels which makes it much faster than the others because its using the sun to power it and get it running, which also helps the environment.
 
 Most people might disagree with me because they think that the trees would do a better job, or that the bottle in sunlight would be much more efficient. I'd agree to disagree because in the tree experiment it would take quite some time before you get water and it doesn't even kill the bacteria it just traps it. With the sunlight experiment it takes six hours and only works in clear water seeing as bacteria can hide in the clay particles. The Speedy filter kills 98 percent of germs, as said previously, which is a lot more reliable than the germs being trapped or only most of them being killed off.
 
 On that last note, those were my reasons on why the Speedy Filter is our best option. Its one more step into getting clean water to those who need it, and its our most reliable step. """"",,,,,,,

I would say that some of us may have a very important call and we may just have to take the call one time ,but do not make it a habit because then it can become dangerous.My first piece of evidence is that the lasting progress will come from educating drivers and convincing them to put safety ahead of immediate access to information. my reason for this is if they want to be safe then they would do what is right and not get on their phone. my second piece of evidence is Something important may happen or may come up. My reason for this is they should be able to have access on their phone because something may happen and would need to call for help.My last reason is to make them learn from their mistakes.

  Speedy Filter is also a good thing to buy because it is not expensive at all,in fact the only thing you will need to buy is the wire. The wire kills the germs by itself. Another good thing is when you capture the germs, the device does not get clogged. Therefore you can use it as many times as you need to.

The Speedy Filter is the best invention to get clean water fast and easy!
 
 One reason why the speedy filter is better than any other invention is because instead of screening out the germs it kills germs as they pass through very small carbon tubes. Fully killing the germs instead of screening them like other inventions can help fully clean the water so itâ€™s better for you. The speedy filter is not as expensive as other inventions. The silver used in the carbon tubes kills bacteria and is very inexpensive! The speedy filter works a lot faster than many other inventions!

14405278,12/2/20,4,Butler Traditional High,Charlene Lynch,SXRZWW,Sydney Ball,NULL,""" Alongside advocating for efforts from car manufacturers and app producers, we need to make phone usage behind the wheel a taboo. To say it how it really is, we need those who choose to endanger others without urgency to be shamed by society. Texting while driving is extremely dangerous; This is a fact that is known by society, but is often downplayed because â€œit couldn't be meâ€. We will need multiple approaches to combat distracted driving: Our most important aspect, societal change, joined with cell phone blocking software from both producers of apps and manufacturers of cars, and education about this software.
  How important is it to care about distracted driving? Youâ€™re probably aware that itâ€™s bad, but what is really beckoning you to care? I have stats; The NHTSA reports that in 2018, 2,841 people were killed by distracted driving and ~400,000 were injured. The 2,841 killed were made up of 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists. Over 400,000 people have been injured, likely severely, or even killed due to distracted driving. At least 1082 of those killed were not driving, therefore they couldnâ€™t have been the ones driving distracted and were killed for no reason. I find it highly unlikely that all of the 1,730 drivers were the distracted drivers in their accidents as well. Let me repeat that they were killed for no reason. Their lives ended for no reason. This is from an American department, by the way. It accounts only for the injuries and deaths of Americans. All of those injuries and deaths came from one country. This may not seem like much still, but think about it; all of those people could have continued their lives as normal, but instead, they were affected by distracted driving. That's absolutely not acceptable in my opinion, and it shouldnâ€™t be in yourâ€™s either. Distracted driving is an important issue and is not to be dismissed.
  Letâ€™s answer some questions about societal change. What do I mean when I say that we need societal change? We need strong education about the dangers of distracted driving (no sugar coating!); we need to push campaigns on social media; in the near future, everyone needs to understand that knowingly driving distracted is way too big of a risk and no good-hearted person would do it unless it is very important. Knowingly driving distracted needs to be shamed, because like I said, no good-hearted person would do it; no good-hearted person would risk the lives of others for a non-urgent reason. Why do we need societal change instead of relying on other mediums? Well, there will always be ways around other methods to prevent distracted driving. David Stayer, a professor of psychology at University of Utah, confirms that drivers will often find ways to disable cell phone blockers in the text â€œTo Fix Distracted Driving, Experts Say Target The People, Not The Techâ€ by Bianca Bosker. Societal change is the most solid way of prevention and unlike cell phone blockers, will not be easily disabled; What I mean is that once society has learned something, it takes time to unlearn it. This idea is why societal change is so valuable in making the world safer for long periods of time.
  Of course, I do not want to completely push cell phone blocking software aside. It too is valuable in combating distracted driving. Cell phone blockers can not be relied on and should not be a permanent solution, but they can be an extra step. Cell phone blockers are apps that prohibit calls and texting behind the wheel, and sometimes prohibit audio features, as well as tracking speed and sudden stops, as described by the NSC. Some blockers also prevent users from accessing unimportant apps. If someone is forgetful about not using their phone while driving, they can use cell phone blockers as prevention. I believe that in the future, cell phone blockers should be undeletable apps provided on phones with their purchase. New cars allow phones to be paired with them, so it seems possible that these apps could recognize that a car is in motion and automatically enable themselves.
  Some people have some fears about the implementation of cell phone blockers. Some of those that I have noticed are fears that you will not be able to contact anyone in an emergency, and will be unable to access your phone as a passenger. The NSC confirms that 911 calls override blocking software and that you can create a whitelist of contacts who can reach you despite the blocker; you can also use your phone as a passenger without being affected by the blocking software. As for feeling like your technology usage isnâ€™t dangerous, they state: â€œSixty-seven percent of those surveyed by NSC said they felt they were at risk because another driver was distracted by technology. Yet, only 25% said their own distraction from technology was putting others at risk.â€ People donâ€™t realize how unsafe they are being when they text behind the wheel, but itâ€™s very unsafe. Letâ€™s revisit the fact that ~400,000 people were killed, in the United States alone, due to distracted driving. With that in mind, canâ€™t you put your phone away for your car ride to keep those around you safe? Do you want to be the person who killed another because you were liking a tweet or talking to your friend about something that could have waited? Even if you donâ€™t think you are putting others in danger, it is always necessary to be safer than sorry.
  Texting behind the wheel is dangerous and should not be acceptable. We need to teach the world why knowingly driving distracted is wrong and shame those who still choose to endanger the lives of others for non-urgent reasons. We can give strong education, without sugar coating, in schools; We can run social media campaigns; We can spread awareness ourselves; We can change the way society views phone usage while driving. We can also take an extra step with prevention by installing mandatory cell phone blockers onto phones with their purchase. We will have to teach society about these blockers in order to make them less uncomfortable for the user. We need to repeat over and over that the deaths and injuries caused by texting behind the wheel were unnecessary and unacceptable. There will need to be multiple approaches to curbing distracted driving and they might take a while to be put in place, but theyâ€™re necessary for ensuring that no one dies due to texting in the future.

15687205,5/23/21,6,Butler Traditional High,Charlene Lynch,SXRZWW,Sydney Ball,NULL,""" There are hundreds of inventions being made for the purpose of filtering water and making it drinkable. The best option is the xylem-inspired filter by Rohit Karnik. Some other good options are SODIS and the Nanotube filter, but the xylem filter outweighs them positively.
  In order to explain why the xylem filter is the best option, we need to analyze the issue at hand. In many places in the world, there is not enough wealth to afford high quality water filters. As a result, people must drink uncleansed water directly from sources near them. This includes rivers, lakes, and muddy holes. The water they are drinking holds diseases, such as cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and more. According to TheWorldCounts, 1,308,050+ people have died from drinking unclean water in 2021. They also state that this crisis kills one person every 10 seconds, amounting to an average of 3,575,000 people per year. Around 2.2 million consists of children. While poor countries do have access to some filters, they are often too expensive for the average family, get clogged, or do not catch bacteria well. Using this information, letâ€™s establish some basic criteria for a good filter. It must be inexpensive to initially afford and maintain, not get clogged, catch bacteria well, and be efficient (circumstance and speed-wise).
  The xylem-inspired filter by Rohit Karnik uses a component of plants called xylem, which are water channels. Water molecules in the roots evaporate upwards, and are pulled through the xylem and into the leaves. This provides water for the plant, just as it could provide water to people. xylem is made up of hollow cells, which have tiny pores in their membranes. These pores prevent air bubbles from clogging the xylem, and are small enough to filter bacteria. Experiments with this invention found that it can filter out almost 100% of bacteria. Additionally, it is a natural resource found in pine trees, meaning it is easily accessible, inexpensive, and biodegradable.
  SODIS (Solar Water Disinfection), invented by Joshua Pearce and Brittney Dawney, is a method in which you simply put the water in a clear bottle exposed to sunlight for 6 hours. This method does not work if the water is muddy, but that can be fixed by adding some salt. There are some concerns with this method. It would be ideal to not have to add anything extra. Muddy holes are common sources of water, so filters should be able to handle cleaning water from them. While salt is low cost, water bottles can become quite pricey in some parts of the world. They can also be harmful to the environment. I also imagine that these bottles would need to be replaced often, as bacteria would build up at the bottom. This filter also takes quite some time to work, and families may not have the time to wait.
  The nanotube filter kills germs as they pass through meshes of silver wires and nanotubes. These silver wires are extremely small, so they are not expensive. As this filter kills germs instead of catching them, it does not get clogged. This filter kills 98% of bacteria, and when powered by a solar panel, it can 80,000 times faster than other filters. It is important to remember that solar panels can cost an average of 20,000 USD, according to EnergySage. Third world countries, who are in need of filters, do not have the money to give this type of filter to the average family. There is also no mention of these filters being biodegradable.
  Letâ€™s look at how each filter matches the criteria. Expensiveness: The xylem-inspired filter is inexpensive and easily found; The SODIS method can be a bit pricey and likely needs to be replaced often; The nanotube filter is inexpensive at itâ€™s core, but itâ€™s best feature is itâ€™s speed, which relies on expensive solar panels. Clogging: The xylem-inspired filter can not be clogged by air bubbles, but it is not clarified whether it gets clogged by bacteria; The SODIS method would likely cause bacteria buildup; The nanotube filter would not be clogged. Catching bacteria: The xylem-inspired filter catches almost 100% of bacteria; The SODIS method separates bacteria, but many times this will require the addition of salt; The nanotube filter kills 98% of bacteria. Efficiency: The xylem-inspired filter is similar to a straw. You can drink it from the water source and the water will be filtered as you drink it; The SODIS method requires additions when the water is muddy, and it often will be. It is very slow compared to other filters; The nanotube filter is extremely quick, with the addition of expensive solar panels. In many circumstances, these will not be available. There is no mention of the nanotube filter not working in certain circumstances.
  The only downside noted for the xylem-inspired filter is a lack of clarification on whether bacteria gets clogged or not. Even if it does, it is so easily accessible that this should not be an issue. While I do believe that the other filters hold roles where they can be very beneficial in combating the drinking-water crisis, they can also be expensive, necessary to replace often, and inefficient. As an added bonus to the xylem-inspired filter, it is biodegradable. Biodegradability is extremely important in these times. WIth all of these factors considered, I believe that the xylem-inspired filter by Rohit Karnik is the best invention and solution to the drinking-water crisis.

The last thing you would want to hear is that they got in accident because of their phone. Distracted driving is very dangerous to you and others around you. A way to help curve the problems of distracted driving would be to help inform drivers about the dangers of being on your phone. My reasons for saying this is that if you teach drivers about how much harm they could cause on the phone while driving, the less likely they would be on their phones in the car. Showing how they could potentially take another life because of their action would likely sway them away from the idea of being on their phone. In the past it has been proven that teaching drivers has affected drivers satisfies. For example the seat belt. In the text they stated this, â€œMaking seat belt usage mainstream relied on a combination of regulation, education and enforcement. Curbing cell phone usage is likely to prove no different, the researchers agreed.â€ This showed informing and teaching drivers helped solved the seat belt issue. Who's to say that cellphones won't be the same. Now right now you could be agreeing or disagreeing saying, ""Well technology from your car could help solve the problem a lot easier. All you had to do is block your phone being used while driving."" Well yes this is true, but many drivers would be instantly fed up with this feature. They would find some way to disable the function from their car so it allows them to use their phones while driving. If you simply informed them about why their phone should be turned off while driving, then the feature from the car would work.

Many tell your friends about how much harm they can cause on the road being on their phone and see how they change.""""",,,,,,,

As many teams of engineers, chemists, and scientists try to think of new inexpensive ways of creating clean water. I believe that the method called, â€˜Speedy Filterâ€™ is the best option. This is due to the fact this filter would be inexpensive for people and can be used multiple times.
 
 The Speedy Filter was created by a team of eight people. Their plan was to kill the bacteria and germs in the water rather than trapping them. They use a small silver wire that is thousands of times thinner than human hair. Since the Speedy Filter is able to kill off the bacteria this will help benefit people. Often due to the fact that filters that donâ€™t kill bacteria they capture them. 
 This was started from the article, â€œThat small amount of silver is not expensive, and the silver kills bacteria. Because this method is killing germs rather than capturing them, the device doesnâ€™t get clogged. So it can be used again and again.â€ The downside of capturing bacteria is the filters easily clog, making replacing them constantly an expensive process. The Speedy Filter would be inexpensive due to the silver wires being cheap and not having to be replaced.
 
 Now you might say that the Tree method would be the best option. Since planting trees while using them in an environmental way would be good for people and the environment it does have some things the Speedy Filter does not. The reason the Speedy Filter is named this is because of how fast the filter processes the water. This was started from the article, â€œIt workedâ€”98 percent of the bacteria were killed! And â€¨by electrifying the device with a small solar panel, it is 80,000 times faster than other filters.â€ The tree method would be good for the environment; the process would take a long time to complete. While the Speedy Filter can complete many cycles before the tree completes one.
 
 The Speedy Filter while still having flaws, as it is still in the testing phase, can be worked out to be a great source of clean water for people. Though it still might cost a bit for the product, compared to its speed and reliability this product will work the best for you.

Do you know someone that text and drives or are on their phones when driving? If you said yes to any of these questions then you are part of the problem.Now you may be asking yourself what problem am I a part of,well you just have to read and find out.The problem that we will be talking about is distracted drivers.Now I believe that you can not blame distracted drivers on the technology;you need to blame the people using the technology.I will prove to you why technology is not the problem and the people are the problem.
 
  The first piece of evidence that supports my claim is ""Even as experts see promise in talking directly to consumers, history suggests that would be only part of the solution. Farrow noted that current views on texting are analogous to attitudes toward seat belts in the 1980 s. Making seat belt usage mainstream relied on a combination of regulation, education and enforcement.""This way something that farrow note;Farrow is a commissioner of the California highway Patrol.This supports my claim because like Farrow said for the seat belt thing it took time so people could get education on how important it was to wear seat belts.Its the same thing with technology these days,you need regulation, education and enforcement to change the way that people see this issue.
  
  My second piece of evidence is ""Rather than just convincing companies to disable their apps while a vehicle is moving or block access to certain tools in the car, lasting progress will come from educating drivers and convincing them to put safety ahead of immediate access to information, researchers said during a panel at the Governors Highway Safety Association conference."". Now this supports my claim because it is talking about how tech companies cant just put up a message that says don't use your phone and people will just go with it.Another thing that I can relate to in real life is that when ever were in a car the message pops up that says don't use your phone when your driving; you can very easily hit the ""I am not driving"" button and get all access to your phone. So as it said putting up a message does little to correct someones bad behavior. 
  
  My last piece of evidence that I have is ""You canâ€™t really talk about distraction and technology without considering the social context in which it happens because the social influences have always pushed bad behavior, even if you have good technology,"".This was said by Nic Ward, a professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at Montana State University.This supports my claim because this well rounded professor is talking about how people can not talk about distraction and technology without considering the social context.People these days are always on there phones and how they used stuff like Twitter and Instagram while driving to keep some type of society norms,and when people are always on their social medias that could become another safety problem .
  Now I know what some people maybe saying stuff like ""they put in those thing that are like tables on your dashboard so you don't have to look at your phone"".Well at the end of the day that does not help.""Technological solutions, such as limiting texting via car infotainment systems, often do little to correct bad driving habits"".This was a quote by David Stayer, a professor in the University of Utah's Department of Psychology.As David said it does little to correct any bad habits,correcting bad habits is the most effective thing that we need to help the issue of distracted drivers.Piggybacking off of that and even if they did put that in you still have to look at it press buttons and when look at it you eyes are not on the road,then that becomes a safety hazard.
 
  In conclusion not all drivers are bad drivers; just the small amount that uses their phones while in a vehicle.There is many different ways that we as a society can change the minds of others like regulation, education and enforcement are all great ways to help change the minds of others.Don't forget to drive safe.

Because I know that I do, But you might be taking water for granted because there are tons of poorer counties that don't have clean water and over million children die to dirty water each year ,dying for drinking water never heard of her. Although some scientists and engineers have thought of a way to solve this-it kills gross germs using small carbon tubes called nanotube topped with a mesh of silver wires. So is this a good idea or is it a good idea.
 Now you may say what makes this method so good and I will tell you. As I said in the into it kills gross germs using small carbon tubes called nanotube topped with topped with a mesh of silver wires. ""Okay and what is so good about that"" you may ask and to that I say , Unlike most filters it doesn't just clean germs it kills them meaning that the filter can be used over and over again, sounds like a good bang for your buck if you ask me.
   Another reason why it is one of the best ways to fix the water problem is that it kills up to 98% of all bacteria. I say that is a pro because some Clorox wipes don't even have a rate of killing 98% of all bacteria. Plus some of the other methods removes bacteria, not kills just removes and you never know what could hiding in these basic filter. Killing 98% of all the bacteria would help to stop the spread of cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and other nasty diseases that is commonly found in dirty water.
 The last piece of evidence that I have for why this the best option for cleaning water at a affordable rate is because it is 80,000 times faster than other filters with the use of solar panels. That beats waiting 6 hours to get some water from some of those other methods. Another thing is that this would help to bring water all over 3-world/poorer counties like Africa for example. 
 Now you maybe saying but ""silver is too much money for poor countries"", But this is totally wrong , the silver is is very very thin making it not that expansive. Now another thing that you may say is something like ""what about this other method that I heard about using sun light and salt ,sun lights free so counties do have to pay money"". That is true sunlight is free but just because something is free does not make it good. For example that method can up to 6 hours before it is done and some people can't wait 6 hours before they want to drink water and another thing is that there is still mud in it even if you put salt in it so how are you going to get the mud out.
 To sum up every thing that has been stated so far poorer counties needs clean water and one of the best ways to do that is to use a method that uses small carbon tubes called nanotube topped with a mesh of silver wires for many reasons like how it can 80,000 times faster then a basic filter can, it kills up to 98% of all bacteria and it can be reused many times.

We need to stop this, we need our people, our drivers to be safe on the road, and we know a way.
  I think in order to stop distracted driving, society needs to shift their view of acceptable phone usage. When going on social media, there are so many influencers, celebrities, and or even family members you see on their phone while driving and even all the time. Fans and you might think that this is fine and normal. You will think you can spend so much time on your cell phone and you might even think you could do it while driving but itâ€™s not. If this continues, a lot of people will not be careful while driving and distracted driving could even increase.
  According to the text they say â€œdrivers should think of driving as they do flying: There will be a set period of travel time when there are no calls made, texts exchanged or emails sent.â€ Theyâ€™re pretty much saying that shifting social norms might work and would help a lot. Theyâ€™re also stating people should have a time and even place when and when not to be on their phone, and thatâ€™s including the car. So if this was the case, then people could limit their time on their cell phone if they didnâ€™t use their phone while driving.
  Despite all these good reasons, some people donâ€™t care and will still attempt to be on their phone any time. But if that continues it could really affect them a lot. It can affect their sleep, it can make them more tired in the day time then night. It can affect your eyes and your sight, make you have bags, and so many other ways. If more people knew about this and the cons of being on your cell phone so much, they could learn when to put the phone down and limit their cell phone time.
  As good as this all sounds, some might say that shifting social norms isnâ€™t that easy. You canâ€™t just easily convince influencers and such to shift social norms like that. Trying another way like tech solutions could work. Tech companies could convince and encourage people to limit their cell phone usage.
  Tech companies may be helpful to help people limit their cell phone usage. But according to the text they say â€œoften do little to correct bad driving habits.â€ Theyâ€™re talking about the tech companies, so they wouldnâ€™t really do as much impact to convince people to limit their cell phone usage as you think. They also say â€œdrivers will often find ways around blocks their systems put in place, using their phone even if their in-car system prohibits it.â€ So even if we went by tech solutions, people will always try to find a way to be in their phone despite what the tech is. It would not help as much and probably not last.
  Distracted driving is a problem, if we can shift social norms and convince everyone to be more careful and limit their cell phone usage. It could help a lot and so many people would be safer on the road.""""",,,,,,,

Any of the inventions would be fine to help dirty water but in my opinion I think speedy filter would be the best for a few reasons.
  I think speedy filter would be the the best way because when using the nanotubes, it doesn't just capture but kill germs, and the device doesn't get clogged so it can kill plenty. Some say Carbon Tubes are good to use when capturing and killing them, but nanotubes are even better because they don't have to capture them to kill them.. they just simply. .kill them.
  Another reason I choose speedy filter to be the best method for dirty water is because they're also not expensive and you can use them again and again. If they can use them again and again and they're cheap this could help a lot and potentially make a big impact on trying to clean dirty water.
  In conclusion we need more inventions like this because kids are dying and we need to help stop this problem the best way we can. And if stuff like this can decrease children from dying or being severely sick, then that is great.

So far In 2018 alone, 2,841 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers. You still stop, then I will tell you why to stop.
 
 
 
 There is one way to stop it is by Creating devices that stop texting while driving or just disable the apps when driving. This would work by the time you stop your phone would unlock and you will be able to use it. My reason is the â€œever-expanding line of devices that aim to curb texting the wheel.â€

Scientist have been searching for ways to make the tap water safer for us to drink and they have found a couple of ways. The ways they have found are: Speedy filters, Sunlight cooking germs, and Trees Providing Clues For Engineers.
 I think the better plan would be to use the sunlight to cook the germs.
 
  I choose the using sunlight to cook germs method because it can be done from home and its inexpensive. ""Sunlightâ€™s heat and ultraviolet light kill most germs."", this shows that the method is effective and it works. The method is easy to test and you can try it at home, ""This research team added salt (sodium chloride), which is low cost. A little bit added to the bottle causes the clay to settle to the bottom of bottle. Then six hours in sunlight can kill off the germs in the water! "" 
 
 A speedy filter is also a great way to get clean water. Others may choose this option because its way faster than using sunlight to cook germs. And that's true! A speedy filter also kills more germs than the sunlight method. But if you're a person with less fortune then the sunlight method is the way to go. And this method uses all natural resources.
 
 Sometimes the inexpensive way is the best way to go. You can use natural things to solve most problems!""""",,,,,,,

 The first reason we should do this is because what this mode does is it disables Wifi and cellular signals stopping you from accessing the internet.This releases that mindset that you have to always be connected to the internet. And â€œJoe Farrow, commissioner of the California Highway Patrol, agreed, saying that drivers should think of driving as they do flying.â€
 
 Another Reason is that since it blocks cellular signals, it blocks all phone calls so you won't get distracted.Joe Farrow also believes that There should be a set period of travel time when there are no calls made, texts exchanged or emails sent.
 
 The last reason I think we should do this is because people won't listen to all the safety tips, and we can't rely on them doing it themselves so it's better if we just put their phone on airplane mode as soon as they enter the car. One thing that is stated in the text is that in 1990 that making people put on seat belts was a problem so they had to start making it mandatory in the law. History has shown that in most cases people usually don't pay attention to the safety precautions . Although it might be hard for people to see the reason why their car forces them to be in airplane mode.
 
 Some people may think that itâ€™s better if we teach them that itâ€™s not okay to text and drive. But weâ€™ve been teaching people that for so long and they still donâ€™t listen, itâ€™s better if we make it so that they canâ€™t text while driving in the car, then make it so that itâ€™s mandatory, and then we can teach them. This is because only teaching them will not work, we also have to make it mandatory, just like what we did with seat belts.
 
 So in conclusion I think that we should create something in the car to put their phones on airplane mode when they're driving in the car. This is because it stops you from accessing the internet making it safer for you, everyone in the car and everyone in the other cars.

The water in some countries is safe but in other countries the water is not good because it is untreated. Scientists and engineers are working to get clean water to these countries. The best invention that helps people get clean water is xylem. 
 
 Xylem is the best invention because it helps to get rid of dirty bacteria from drinking water. The article states, "" Xylem consists of stacks of hollow cells. At the ends are membranes with tiny pores that prevent air bubbles from growing in size. These pores are just the right size to filter out bacteria.""

 Another reason xylem is the best invention is because it's made from a material that is accessible and inexpensive for third world countries that don't have clean water. 
 According to the article,"" Xylem would provide a readily available cheap, and biodegradable material."" This shows that third world countries could have a cheap solution. 
 
 The final reason xylem is the best invention is because xylem can get out all of the bacteria that is needed. The article states,"" Of course they ran experiments.

I believe that instead of getting a fine for texting and driving people should get jail time. Some would say that it is extreme. They could just fine people, but no matter the fine people still use their technology while driving.
 
 The reason people should get jail time is because jail is a scary place and people get scared to do something if it means jail time. Getting a fine is not as scary. A lot of people don't care about fines. This will help prevent the use of technology while driving. Evidence from the text states that with seatbelts there was a similar struggle with seatbelts. ""Farrow noted that current views on texting are analogous to attitudes toward seat belts in the 1980s. Making seat belt usage mainstream relied on a combination of regulation, education and enforcement. Curbing cell phone usage is likely to prove no different, the researchers agreed."" Another reason jail time should be permitted with texting and driving is that jail is a correctional facility. Jail is supposed to make people learn from their mistakes and not do the same mistake. 
 
 This evidence supports the reason by dating back in time where people were having the same type of issue with seatbelts where people did not listen and did not wear seatbelts so it was taken to the next level and was made a law.

Children are dying every year just because of the simple fact that they cannot get clean water. They get their water from rivers but that water is to dirty for them to drink. I believe Joshua Pearce and Brittany Dawney's invention could be a cheap, easy, and fast solution.
  One reason I believe this could work is because of how much time it takes for the water to clean with their invention. They state in the text that ""...six hours in sunlight can kill off the germs in the water!"" This isn't that much time considering it's easier and faster than the other inventions.
  Another reason is because if the water is muddy (in which most cases it is) then you can use cheap and easy salt. A little bit of salt can force the mud to sink down to bottom of the bottle. As said in the text ""Germs can hide among clay particles in murky water. This research team added salt (sodium chloride), which is low cost. A little bit added to the bottle causes the clay to settle to the bottom of bottle."" 
  My last reason for believing my claim is because while using this method the germs are not being captured but instead they are being killed. This is great because the water is being properly decontaminated in a natural way. Instead of germs swimming around in the water they drink the germs are killed and the water will be germ free.

Finally there would be less accidents if you couldn't use apps while driving because with little to no access to apps there would be less distracted drivers lowering the chance of an accident. I am aware of the fact that not every one uses apps while driving but the people that do use apps while driving are more likely to get into an accident and not allowing them to use apps while driving would be a much safer option.

 Most filters can get clogged by bacteria so you can only use them once but the speedy filter doesn't get clogged because it kills' the bacteria when used allowing you to use them more than once.
 The speedy filter kills 98 percent of germs making the water clean enough for people to drink unlike other filters that just capture them and get clogged. The speedy filter is also cheap and made of nanotubes topped with silver wires allowing more people to get one if they don't have access to clean water.
 This evidence supports my claim because its a filter that can be re used and is extremely cheap.

It will decease the distraction of the driver.It will keep you from getting distracted. It will decrease bad behavior and increase good behavior and lastly, technology can force good behavior.
 
  Firstly, it will keep you from getting distracted. When people get on their phones while driving its usually because of text messages and notifications. In the text it states,""On the airplane, I can't talk to someone for an hour and fifteen minutes,"" Farrow said in an interview. ""When you get in the car, all this should go away.""So this means if its blocked then they wont be distracted. 
 
 The second reason is it will decrease bad behavior and increase good behavior. In the text it states, ""lasting progress will come from educating drivers and convincing them to put safety ahead of immediate access to information, researchers said during a panel at the Governors Highway Safety Association conference."" This means it will shift social norms and you will get used to it. Just like a seat belt, people will get used to just doing whats safe.
 
 Lastly, technology can force good behavior. In the text it states, â€œWard suggested one solution might be to shift social norms to de-emphasize instant information gratification and move away from the expectation that people should always be on and constantly connected.â€ This means if people see other people doing the right thing, others will begin to do it.
 
 Although some people might think this will not work because You can turn off airplane mode whenever you want and people will still do bad even with technology's help. But it will still decrease bad behavior. So to sum all of this up, putting your phone on airplane mode will help decrease distracted driving because It will keep you from getting distracted. it will decrease bad behavior and increase good behavior and

Many people wonder how to stop this so less people get hurt. Auto and Tech industries have been working and trying to make information more accessible while driving. According to the article, "" Drivers can now update Facebook via their Mercedes and will be able to chit chat with Siri via their dash..."". This quote from the article is stating that companies are now trying to make technology in the car hands free. This can help correct bad driving habits. 
 
 Another way to stop distracted driving is to have something similar to an airplane mode but for a car. According to Joe Farrow who is commissioner of the California Highway Patrol says drivers should think of driving as they do flying. ""There will be a set period of travel time when there are no calls made, texts exchanged or emails sent"", as stated from the article. 
 
 A final possible way to stop distracted driving is to treat distracted driving like wearing seat belts. Bianca Bosker says,""Making seat belt usage mainstream relied on a combination of regulation, education and enforcement. Curbing cell phone usage is likely to prove no different..â€This is saying we should educate people on the need to stop being on their phones while driving.
 
 Some people think differently about distracted driving and how we should stop it. Those people think that people should be able to choose on their own whether they should use their phone while driving. Another argument is it is hard to enforce everyone to stop using their phone while driving. Thereâ€™s a problem with this argument people choosing can be dangerous. Them choosing to use their phones while driving can cause people to get hurt. Distracted driving is a very dangerous problem and there are a ton of ways to stop it.""""",,,,,,,

In fact over 1 billion people do not have access to clean water and have to take water from places like rivers, lakes, and even muddy holes in the ground. This is a huge problem for the kids especially over 1 million children die each year just from not having clean water. And form most not just kids dehydration can be deadly.
 
 Besides all of that engineers and scientist from all over are finding new ways to help create clean drinking water, but in my perspective the best invention to help create clean water is the speedy filter.
 
 My reasoning on why this is the most efficient way to clean water is because it is topped with a mesh of silver wires thinner then a strand of human hair, and because it is made out of this material it will never get clogged up with harmful germs. Witch then means you can use this product over and over again without worrying about drinking unsafe water! For some more reasoning in the text it states that it ""doesnâ€™t screen out germs. Instead, it kills germs as they pass through very small carbon tubes topped with a mesh of silver wires."" Hints to why you can reuse this product as many times as you want, and why it is the best method to start cleaning water. Another piece of evidence that supports my claim is in the article it states that "" 98 percent of the bacteria were killed! And by electrifying the device with a small solar panel, it is 80,000 times faster than other filters."" Therefore it is more efficient than any other method and is affordable and accessible to anyone.
 
 On the flip side of things there is a method that eliminates/filters out 100% of bacteria from murky waters and so on and so forth. This method shadows how a plant would work and uses xylem from pine trees. Coming from the text it ""consists of stacks of hollow cells. At the ends are membranes with tiny pores that prevent air bubbles from growing in size. These pores are just the right size to filter out bacteria."" And from proven test it does in fact filter out 100% of bacteria. But on the other hand it only filters them out when the method that's best kill 98% of bacteria and is affordable, reusable, and faster than any other method i've seen.
 
 But all in all any method preferably the "" affordable, reusable, and faster "" method will start help cleaning up all water around the world! This will change a lot of peoples lives who don't have access to clean water, and maybe make a difference in this world somehow.""""",,,,,,,

This supports my argument because if people won't listen, then we should create something that will disable technology while it is in the car. Another reason to disable technology in a car is because it can stop cell phone addiction. If you are constantly on your phone, even while you are driving, then that is a problem. Disabling phones while they are inside a car would cut down a lot of peoples screen time. According to the article, using any form of technology inside a car can be a sign of addiction to that technology.This supports my argument because it shows that most people aren't ready to give up their technology, so it needs to be disabled while it is inside a car.Finally, the last reason why technology should be disabled inside a car, is because it is in the interest of public safety. According to the article, distraction is a big issue for traffic safety. This supports my argument because it shows that distracted driving can do harm to yourself or others which is why we need to disable all technology while it is inside a car in order to protect everyone on the road. Some people argue that cell phones shouldn't be disabled while in a car because if something happens to you while driving, you need your phone to contact emergency services.

While that might be a really good way to stop distracted driving, there are some safe ways to answer phone calls and texts while driving. If you're getting a call you can just put the call on speaker or just simply put in headphones so you dont have to actually pick up your phone. If you get a text that you need to reply to, most smartphones allow you to answer the text without even touching your phone. All you have to do is just use speech to text with what ever phone assistant you have (like Siri or Google). I've tested the speech to text on my phone and it works pretty well.

 The tree method states that it is made to mimic how plants get there water. how the plants transfer water from there roots and the its taken to the leaves the plants and plants do not pump water trough their leaves instead they rely on the evaporation of water from the leaves through there stomata. The tree method uses water channels with something called a xylem , its pulled upward , the pull is similar as if "" your sucking up water through a straw. If air bubbles were to build up in a plantâ€™s water channels, the bubbles would block the flow of water. But fortunately, the xylem isnâ€™t simply made up of hollow tubes. Xylem consists of stacks of hollow cells. "" it's also been found that pin trees can remove bacteria from water with filtration system , "" Xylem would provide a readily available, cheap, and biodegradable material. Of course, they ran experiments. Almost 100 percent of the test bacteria (Escherichia coli) were trapped! "" meaning that there was bacteria that was trapped i do not feel that this is a good idea I feel like they can do way better with the , speedy filter. 
 
 Next is the sunlight method , this method is smart for water but I feel it should be used with like water that is not as bad then it would be a better solution and I also feel like boiling the water like as mentioned in the ""sunlight cooks germs"" solution. The sunlight solution was going to be used to treat water with ""SODIS"" you take the water and but it into a clear water bottle and let it sit in sunlight for 6 hours , this method can kill germs however this doesn't work if the water is muddy. they added salt to the water , and it causes the clay to settle down to the bottom. this method was discovered and based off an old engineering article. this is a very smart method but i feel its keeping us in the same problem with the water being contaminated , so i feel that the speedy filter is better than both of these , methods. 
 
 Lastly I feel this is the best method that and is most effective Is the best one is the speedy filter. and this has been proven too kill germs instead of screen out germs. the process Î…kills germs as they pass through very small carbon tubes (nanotubes) topped with a mesh of silver wires.
