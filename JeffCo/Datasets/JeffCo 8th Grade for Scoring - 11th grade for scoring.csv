 Evidence: Some also believe that it leads to poorer rather than better customer service and satisfaction. Thatâ€™s because it supposedly attracts younger, part-time and less professional workers to tipped occupations, undermines serversâ€™ intrinsic motivations to care for their customers, discourages service enhancing teamwork among servers and encourages discrimination in service delivery against customers believed to be poor tippers.
 
 
 Conclusion:
 There are people who tip to reward servers for service. If the server does a great job, I want to express my gratitude so that is another motivation for tipping. But how strong is that motivation? My research suggests itâ€™s not terribly strong. I find the relationship is so weak that it would be wrong to use tipping as a measure of service quality.
 People often say thatâ€™s their major motivation for tipping if you were to ask them. But when we ask people how much they tipped and how they would rate the quality of the service, less than four percent of the differences in tips left by different dining parties can be explained by their ratings of service quality.

I still thing tipping should not be banned from restaurants or any kind of job that can tip. I'm not to sure why this is even a debate since its the costumers money and there choice to make that decision.
 
 Tipping acts like a token of appreciation for the people who serve you as a ""thank you for your service"". If tipping was banned, then it will further discourage the service people to work at a restaurants and the people that they get the tips from will feel bad because they work all day and probably making minimum wage. The costumers can at least tip a few dollars as a thank you. This can decrease the amount of people who work at a restaurants which can lead to a lost of money because of that. I'm not telling you to tip hundreds of dollars or even twenty dollars to a waiter but you can. Just a reminder that some people who serve you at a table is probably having a really bad day and a few dollar tip is enough to make their day.
 
 I see why people want tipping ban because of discrimination. That people with a different skin or culture could get treated differently then others, i see that. But that's not what tipping is. Tipping is a choice and a choice for the better. In this article it mentions "" tippingâ€™s favor is that it allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices, which stingier tippers like because it reduces the costs of eating out."" which is a very good thing to the restaurant and the costumers. Another thing to mention is that, the customer wont really like this policy because the article mention ""most consumers in the United States say that they prefer tipping over automatic service charges or inclusive pricing."" The point of a restaurant is to get what the consumers are asking for, not what you want. If your food revolves around chicken, don't switch it up to fish or seafood. Same thing goes for tipping. Not only you want to make your costumers happy, but you also need to make your employees happy as well to make them stay longer.
 
 Although there are some tipping alternatives that can help out both the employees and the restaurants itself. I wouldn't think it would be a good idea because the alternatives that they mention says that ""automatic service charges, in which a tip is tacked on to all bills, and service-inclusive pricing."". This is good for the employees since they get a guaranteed amount of money. What's not good is the customer because they are forced to pay a sum amount of money and no way to go around it. Think of tips as like a charity event. You dont have to, but it is greatly appreciated if you gave money to them.
 
 Even though people might not agree with tipping. Tipping is the main part of restaurants and should never be separated or banned from any restaurant place. It is the reason why employees like to be in restaurants . It is also a good deed to the costumers and make them feel better about themselves.

 I personally do not think tipping is harmful to customers as much as it is to the server because I work in food services and the tips help us out a lot it basically adds a dollar on to what we get paid and it also makes us want to give customers a great service by putting smiles on our faces and brightening up our days a little. Tipping just shows us a little appreciation since we are waking up very early and working long ours to service, feed, and entertain others. Servers all around are depending on tips to make a full days worth of minimum wage hourly pay. restaurants make cheaper priced menus to encourage tippers to want to tip since the price wasn't crazy as it kind of said in the article. 
 
 some may argue that "" tipping puts unwanted social pressure on people to part with money they would rather keep."", but i feel like its just a respect thing. like if you know someone has been up all day/night or if you know that tipping is apart of their pay then it should encourage you to want to tip more to show some appreciation, and it would also increase the satisfaction of your service. if you knew you couldn't afford to tip even a little like 5% then you shouldn't have ate out in my opinion. 
 
 This just goes to show how much tipping makes a difference to servers. Many of them have bills, kids, debts to pay and tipping honestly helps. think if it was you or you're children, you would be mad or upset if you or they were working hard all day just to get paid little to nothing.

A debate over continuing to tip or move towards inclusive pricing has accompanied tipping in recent years, and has brought the practice of tipping into question. Restaurants should ban tipping, as discrimination against wait staff greatly impacts tip amounts received and it creates an unhealthy competitive environment.
 Discrimination against wait staff greatly affects the amount of money workers receive from tips. Less attractive servers and servers of color, as mentioned in the first paragraph on the section Debate over tipping, often receive lower tip values because of customers judging them for things outside of their control. It is unfair for workers to be paid less purely because they are a different race than their customer or because their customer doesn't find them attractive. Tipping also allows for predatory customers to sexually harass workers by threatening to take away their tip or complain about them if they don't go along with what the customer wants, which is even more unfair to wait staff and makes them uncomfortable at their job, suggesting that banning tipping would make wait staff safer and more satisfied with their jobs.
 Furthermore, tipping can create an unhealthy competitive work environment. Competing to get paid fairly can encourage workers to treat poor tippers worse or can discourage teamwork, as said in the second paragraph in the section Debate over tipping. Promoting an environment where workers can't rely on each other because they have to compete for adequate paychecks nurtures potential problems within staff, which could spill over into working with customers and effect a customer's experience. Communications between staff about a regular customer who tips poorly can also result in staff not trying to please them, as they know they won't receive proper compensation for their work. Both of these scenarios would cause a drop in customer satisfaction and a subsequent drop in ratings of the establishment, suggesting that tipping should be banned to prevent these issues.
 Although tipping is shown to be associated with higher ratings in a restaurant, as demonstrated in the Crab Shack Experiment section, tipping alternatives do not drastically bring down ratings. Using automatic service charges resulted in a drop of a third of a point and using inclusive pricing results in a decline of only approximately a tenth of a point. A drop in ratings by a tenth of a point is less cause for concern than workers being harassed or mistreated by customers, or being forced to compete in an unhealthy way, making banning tips the logical thing to do.""""",,,,,,,

 Tipping motivates employees to work harder, this is where customer service comes into play. There was also an experiment done where they cut tipping completely and raised there menu prices, after six months they revered every change they had just made to go back to tipping and lowered there food prices back to what they were. 
 
 Not only does tipping benefit the employees, it is better on the restaurant itself, as you saw from the experiment above.

With much thought and using information given in the passage I've come to the decision that restaurants should ban tipping. 
  Restaurants pay ""workers low and unreliable incomes"" and more often than not, relying on tips to survive is just not enough. Depending on the amount of customers and tips they are given that night workers could make little to no money. Not to mention that some weeks workers could make plenty of money and other weeks not even enough to pay the bills. Relying on tips and never knowing what you will receive makes it really hard to survive. 
  Not only are restaurant workers paid low incomes but they are often discriminated against and tipped not based upon the quality of their service. Tipping makes room for ""discriminating against less attractive servers as well as servers of color and empowers customers to sexually harass female servers."" There are plenty of times where workers are tipped less because they aren't found attractive enough by their customers even thought their service was excellent. On the other hand females and also males are often tipped based upon their appearance instead of their service. 
  Tipping workers can lead to poor customer service and poor customer satisfaction. Jobs that rely on tipping often ""attract younger, part time and less professional workers."" Meaning that many of the workers are young people who have no financial responsibility and just want a little money in their pocket. They are much more likely to not take the job seriously and provide high quality service because they aren't depending on the job to survive. Customers may often be less satisfied because they feel obligated to give a tip even if they aren't satisfied with the service they've received. This could lead to less business and poor reviews because customers dislike paying for a service that they aren't fully satisfied with. 
  Despite the many reasons as to why tipping should be stopped, some may argue that tipping ""allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices."" Even though this may be true, the price of the food you get plus a tip will not be much more expensive than just paying more for your food with no tip.
  In conclusion, I believe that even though tipping is a controversial subject it should be stopped for many reasons. workers are payed to low and unreliable incomes, workers are often discriminated against, and tipping can lead to poor customer service and satisfaction. """"",,,,,,,

 Many people who work and depend on tips are tipped by the way they look to their customer. ""discriminates against less attractive severs... servers of color and empowers customers to sexually harass female servers."". Many people only tip on these circumstances. Waitresses of color could most likely have the hardest time being both female and a person of color, because not only are there people harassing them, but there is most likely the amount of people hating them because they are a person of color. With the ability to make an unbelievable amount of money in a small amount time appeals to many unqualified people, which makes terrible service and not the money they thought they would get.

How should we do this, keep like it is, or take it and make inclusive prices. We could make an argument for both sides. But one shows more significance and easier for workers. Let me bring to the table and show you some evidence why.
 One reason why tipping is so good is because it makes the staff work harder. If the workers thought they were only going to make what they're wage is, they wouldn't work as hard or be as motivated to do their job as well. People react well to rewards for their hard work. So there would be a lot poorer customer service and customer dissatisfaction is not something good for a business.
 Secondly we have the automatic service charges. People who like these consist of those who want a cheaper dinning experience. However this effects server customer bond. Servers no longer get a tip based on how well they serve you, now they have automatic charges and they don't decide how much servers get. Service charges also did not go well with customer because now without tipping, those charges decide how cheap or pricey their meal is.
 As well without tips servers would have a really hard time making a living just making wages. The majority of food industry workers don't get paid that much and tips help. Some would argue that it is ""an unreliable source of income"", according to Michael Lynn and his studies in ""How the war on tipping harms customers"". However these people already make low wages if that were true, five dollars from a customer couldn't hurt them. The majority of people don't like that now they don't have the choice and now their food cost more because they need higher wages.
 In conclusion, wages are beneficial for all. The workers have an easier time making money. They have more motivation to work harder for tips and improves customer satisfaction. The companies hiring the workers don't have to pay as much for wages and food prices can be lower. Everything seems to work out better with tipping still in place.""""",,,,,,,

I enjoy giving tips as well, and it feels great to also have a choice to tip doesn't it because if a person's service wasn't well you don't have to give a tip. With that being said i believe restaurants should not ban tipping. Due to workers not being able to have motivation, customers not having a choice, and certain restaurants may suffer.
 To begin with, think about being a worker who earns tips and you feel that you work hard for them. Then ""BAM"" tips are taken away, would you have motivation to care whether or not a person is happy unless you feel like just having basic human decency. In the text there was a study found using Joes Crab Shack, the shack took away tips and then noticed reviews going down with their customer satisfaction of their dining experiences. Even in real life i see people who try their best to do what they can to make sure i enjoy my experience at a restaurant, I know it's because they want a tip but I am okay with that. Also just seeing the joy in people when they receive an amazing tip.
 As a customer who would want to be forced to give tips to a service that wasn't even good. That's why tipping should be a choice. And as seen in the text comments on inclusive tipping resulted in lower ratings in studies. Now it's understandable that its hard to pay people in a company because you never know how much servers could get but that's why giving a certain amount on a pay check that's not to much or too little will help.
 Lastly, if all restaurants were told they have to charge inclusive pricing restaurants that seem less formal then they may suffer. Do to people not already expecting to pay a tip. For example, Joe's Crab Shack suffered a 3rd of a point decline while, expensive restaurants only suffered a 10th. And with people not wanting to pay tips or inclusive pricing they may have to pay more than expected causing less people to want to go to certain restaurants. 
 On the other hand you could say tipping is unfair for most and that servers could become sexualized, but all in all the world isn't fair. Also people may make more when earning their own tips anyways no matter your looks with respectful behavior.
 In conclusion, Restuarants should not ban tipping, tipping is just simple courtesy and if a customer feels a person deserves it then it should be given.""""",,,,,,,

Customers are used to a normal tipping method, 10 to 20%, and changing this for an alternative method would cause a lot of problems. Normal tipping methods promote better customer service, especially from younger servers. Requiring a tip to servers also allows restaurants to keep the prices of their meals lower, which will satisfy customers more than an inclusive menu pricing. 
 
 As someone who was previously a restaurant server, tips were the biggest and almost only motivation that I had. Servers make more income from good service and tips than they do from their normal wage. According to How the war on tipping harms customers, ""Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service."". 
 
 If tipping is abolished, restaurant prices will climb. This adds money to your bill, and essentially adds tax onto the tip that is already included on your bill. In an experiment in the article, Joe's Crab Shack took away customary tipping, and made it inclusive to the customers bill and their menu items. Customers did not like this change, and they found that '...customers rated Joeâ€™s Crab Shack restaurants higher â€“ by about a third of a point on a five-point scale â€“ when they operated under tipping than when they used service-inclusive pricing."" 
 
 I think to better customer service and to satisfy customers, tipping should not be banned. Banning tipping will increase the prices of menu items and will dissatisfy customers.

Some restaurants come with good and bad workers, however their main goal is to satisfy the customer. Just like anybody else, customers would lie to receive the best service, and when the servers do so, customers would reward the employee for their service. There is controversy whether or not tipping should be abolished. Due to the many hardships of a server, restaurants should alternate tipping with automatic service charges or inclusive pricing. 
 Adversaries of tipping believe that tipping pays it's laborers unreliable incomes. The minimum wage of a server is $7.25, not including tips. Tips are based on the server's performance and the customer's order. For example, if the service is average, the appropriate amount to tip is 15% of what the customer ordered, whereas if the service were above average, the appropriate amount to tip is 20%. Given that it is uncertain what the customer may order, the tip you receive is unknown. There may be cases in which a customer feels generous enough to tip more, and cases in which customers doesn't tip at all. That goes into the argument that tipping puts unwanted social pressure on people to part with money they'd rather keep. 
 Not only does the performance of a server and the customer's order contribute to the amount you are getting tipped, but your race, looks, and/or, sex can determine a lot as well. There are numerous servers of color that are discriminated against. Less enticing servers are likely to be victimized. Tipping also empowers customers to sexually harass female servers. Looks should not be overpowered by great service!
 Restaurants attract younger, part-time and less professional workers. Receiving those tips undermines servers' intrinsic motivations to care for their customers. Many cease to believe that tipping increases rather than decreases customer service due to the encouragement of the server to bring forth great service for the tip. However, receiving a tip is one of the most obscured things. You don't know whether you will receive a tip or not. Not to mention that either way, there aren't going to be the best customers or servers.
 Alternating tips with automatic service charges or inclusive pricing allows for a stable income and a safer place to work in. """"",,,,,,,

""The studyâ€™s data do not tell me why service charges decreased ratings more than did inclusive-pricing, but I suspect that it was because consumers hate being forced to tip more. Higher prices, on their own, are less objectionable."" Tipping had greater ratings since there wasn't a tipping you necessarily had to pay.
 
 Also if most restaurants turned tipping into service charges the type of customers attracted would change along with other things. ""Their wealthier customers, who are less sensitive to the added costs of service charges or inclusive-pricing, are less likely to punish them."" So, the customers the restaurants would need to make money are rich people or people who like to fine dine and don't mind spending money on food if they did automatic service charges. Restaurants should keep tipping available if they want to keep that high number of customers and money coming through.
 
 Some people do believe though that tipping leads to workers being sexually harassed and discriminated and that focus is taken off of the dining experience of customers with tipping. The harassing and discriminating would decrease if people on average became more mature and sensitive about people and not racist and discriminatory. People usually say that tipping takes focus off of the dining experience of customers since the workers are just working for money and not really as much for the caring and satisfying the customers. When actually people may be inspired or encouraged by money to work harder and also to work harder to get more tips so people obviously want to treat their customers well. Therefore, tipping should not be banned especially since it can have more benefits for restauants and the food and fine dining industry.""""",,,,,,,

Many people have especially as a starting job where people make their grand step into adulthood in both fast food joints as well as sit-down restaurants. Though they may serve different food, be owned by different people, etc. there are some things that they both depend on-- tips. Workers rely on them to get paid more money than their small wages, sometimes, to make ends meet. However, some people are pushing for tips to be banned altogether in some restaurants. Restaurants should not ban tips because it gives incentive for workers to strive to put out only their best, lowers the price of the menu (which anyone would like to see), and increases customer satisfaction, not decrease it.
 
 First of all, tips should be continued to be allowed since it motivates employees to put out higher quality of service. People come to rely on tips since many restaurants tend to pay lower wages that are closer to minimum wage. Living a life based solely on the income provided by being is infeasible and mostly work to be there as a supplemental job or a way for teens to get jobs. Additionally, you can see some aspects of communism be seen in what the other side advocates for in inclusive pricing. If all workers are paid the same amount of tips then there's no real motivation to try their best which also happened in the USSR. While on the other hand, if wages depend on how well you do a job like in being tipped, it encourages better service (like in capitalism.)
 
 Another reason as to why tipping should still be allowed is that the price of the menu would be lowered. As briefly mentioned before, inclusive pricing (which is the practice of incorporating a tipping fee to the total price of a meal) increased prices since it added a set amount of extra money to having to be paid. A great example to what happens in such a phenomena is what happened with Joe's Crab Shack where they tried using inclusive menu-prices in 18 restaurants, 14 of them chose to go back to the original system of tipping. Furthermore, reviews of the locations who chose to use inclusive pricing tended to have a review that was lower by a third than their counter parts. Many reviews also spoke of the topic of tipping or servers and were generally associated with lower ratings.
 
 Finally, the addition of an inclusive pricing or it's similar alternatives has overall decreased customer satisfaction. When people are not given a choice and are forced to pay higher prices, people tend to be unhappier. You can ask Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and the other founding fathers on this one. Critics argue that this tends to be better a better choice because it would increase the wages of all workers. However, the restaurant could simply choose not to increase workers' wages or raise them in a small amount or earn less than what could've been earned from being tipped normally.
 
 To summarize, because tips gives incentive for workers to strive to put out only their best, lowers the price of the menu, and increases customer satisfaction, tips should be allowed as well as protected. If it is not protected, then the forgotten people of society who work hard everyday-- like grandparents and immigrants-- whose wages are already low enough as is can be further lowered. To protect the restaurant, you must protect the people running it, if not then this sector of the economy will collapse. Will you allow such a grim demise to occur?

Is the question that journalist and some social commentators have argued and tried to answer for some years now. And yes tipping is a very controversial subject but I do believe that restaurant should not ban tipping and hereâ€™s why.
  See iâ€™m all about pro tipping because as someone who works in the food service industry and gets paid minimum-wage people tipping is a blessing because itâ€™s our primary source of income . and thatâ€™s the same everywhere because most food service workers are often paid minimum wage or even less and their checks/pay are mostly based off the tips. especially young adults and even adults who have to provide for families and pay their bills really look forward to tips. So if restaurants decided to ban tipping then those workers will not be getting good enough pay to provide for themselves nor their families and that something then nobody realizes and nobody realizes how much $1 can really go help and go a long way for me and these other food service workers.
  Now letâ€™s talk about how servers deal with a lot of stuff. They have to deal with rude and difficult customers, large groups of people, they have to cleanup the mess,and they also have to put away there sad emotions and put on a fake smile. So just imagine having to deal with all of that, being paid minimum-wage, and your main source of income is tips. Then all of a sudden restaurants ban tips. That would cause food-service workers to become hopeless and most likely decrease their customer service as well because they wonâ€™t have nothing to look forward to while working.
  Continuing on the topic about good customer service, I feel like tipping plays a big role of food services workers and their great customer service. The reasoning is because when customers are being generous and leave a tip especially when tips arenâ€™t required it shows how the workers are appreciated for all they do and all they go through and it makes them strive to be a great worker. Plus when workers have great customer service it pleases the customers and will make the customers leave a great review and tell their friends and family which will make them keep coming back to the restaurant along with more people. Far example just think about Chick-fil-A and how people love it.It is simply because of their customer service.
  There are many arguments against tipping. Like how it puts unwanted social pressure on people to give their money that they want to keep and how it distracts customers from their dining experience. But like Iâ€™ve said tipping actually benefits both customers and the workers because it can create a bond between the 2 and tipping leads to The servers to continue on their great customer service and that leads to customer satisfaction. and about the unwanted social pressure tips arenâ€™t mandatory, so their shouldnâ€™t be any type of pressure because nobodyâ€™s forcing anybody to tip, but obviously tips are greatly appreciated.
  So in conclusion to answer the question on should restaurants ban tipping? with all of my reasonings and with proven points about servers being paid minimum-wage and their main source of income is from tips, dealing with a whole Lotta crap, and tips encouraging them to have great customer service.

Restaurants should not ban tipping because it assists in providing livable wages, betters customers experiences, and brings in workers. 
 Tipping provides servers or other minimum wage or below workers with potential livable wages. Many servers make $2-$3 an hour and delivery drivers make $4-$5. If tips were banned, those workers wouldn't make livable wages. The inclusive price says it includes tips but doesn't describe how they are given out. Some companies may not give the tips to the workers, or some may put them on their check which ends up getting them taxed and making less. Inclusive pricing would also make it difficult for lower income people or families to eat out while regular tipping makes it affordable because they can leave what they can afford. It makes it more appealing to both the workers and customers when tips are not banned but also not included in the menu price.
 As the passage states "" proponents of tipping claim it increases rather than decreases customer service and satisfaction."" Tips are supposed to be based on service and hospitality on the servers part, and although there are guidelines or preferred amount, most tips are. Having the motivation of extra cash pushes the servers to be kind and put more effort into the customers experience than if it were not allowed. 
 The opponents of tipping believe it is discriminatory, unreliable, and empowers servers to be harassed. Although the wages are low, tipping raises them and also provides quick cash to employees which is always helpful. It isn't discriminatory or empowering to harassment because it is solely based on the servers hospitality and service. If it was based on anything else and is blatantly stated to be the businesses have protocols set in place for those kind of problems. 
 Allowing tipping brings in more workers as well. Not only does it bring in those who enjoy customer service but younger and older workers as well. A job that allows tipping could attract teenagers over the summer for the need of some quick cash or elderly people year round that want something to do with a little bit of money involved. Knowing that you have the potential to make tips always encourages workers to do the best they can do when interacting with customers. 
 Overall, tipping has many more benefits than banning it. It provides livable wages, better service, and a raise in workers and ratings. Although some believe tipping should be banned, there are much stronger arguments and first hand experiences to rebut that. In the end, tips are used as a motivation and do so for majority of the workers able to get them. """"",,,,,,,

I believe that they should make it a set amount that you have to give you server unless they were just terrible. These people make their livings off these tips since their actual paychecks are always extremely low. If we ban tipping, restaurants in will have to up their workerâ€™s pays which will lead to more expensive food and less happy customers. We definitely need to keep the tipping system. 
 
 If we ban tipping in restaurants, we will be taking away almost all of the workers pay. On average, workers make less than minimum wage on their paychecks. They survive almost completely off of tips. Youâ€™re average waiter or waitress will be payed $3 to $5 per hour. Assuming they work 6 hour shifts, that gives them $18 to $30 that they made in 6 hours. Thatâ€™s not a paycheck they can live off of. Weâ€™d be seriously hurting them if we took away tips.
 
 Not only would we be hurting workers but also the people eating at the restaurant. If we take away tipping, the workerâ€™s pay will have to go up. That means that the restaurant owners will have to have more money to pay their workers. This will mean that the prices of the restaurant will go up quite a bit, leaving the customers to pay more for their food. This is all an unnecessary situation that can be avoided if we just keep tipping. 
 
 To avoid angry workers and customers, we can simply make a set tip on customerâ€™s checks. A customer would have the tip automatically put on their check and if they were extremely unsatisfied with their serverâ€™s service, they could talk to the boss and have the tip either taken off or lowered. This would still give the customers some sort of control over the tip but still make sure that the server definitely gets a tip. This ensures happiness on both sides.
 
 Overall, we need to keep tipping in restaurants. If we take it away, we upset both the workers and the customers in the long run. We just need to make a set tip that can be changed if not satisfied. This is the easiest thing we could do that will make everyone happy. If someone wants to tip directly, they can. If they want it set on their bill, they can have that. We just need to be sure that we donâ€™t get rid of tips over all.

With large classes, there is a higher chance of distraction and a lower chance of actually learning. So whats the solution to solve this issue? well its quite simple; the school system should reduce the number of students in a class room. Reducing the classroom size can greatly help the students learn and go beyond their limits.
 
 Why reduce size you may ask? Studies show that fewer students in a classroom can greatly benefit students. The article ""When Good Science Goes Bad"" written by Tribune News Service states ""After four years, students in the small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math. They continued to do better even after returning to regular-sized classes."" This data was from a experiment called Project Star and in said experiment they studied students in smaller classes and larger classes. The students in smaller classes were smarter and faster thinking than the larger class kids.
 
 Not only did reduced classroom kids become smarter, they had a higher percentage to graduate high school and attend college. The passage before stated ""As the kids grew up, the ones who had been in small classes graduated from high school and attended college at higher rates."" There is no coincidence that they had higher rates as they were more smarter than large classroom students and it would make since that they graduate and attend college.
 
 Concerned adults may argue and point out that California's government tried this approach and failed horribly. I counter that because California rushed its approach on smaller classes and it was the government to blame. The article quoted previous times wrote ""Schools had to hire about 18,000 new teachers in the programÂ’s first year, many within weeks of the July announcement."" In July 1996, California passed a legislation that reduced class size. This was sudden and schools had to hire many new teachers to accommodate more classes. This backfired however as these new teachers were not properly trained. Any benefit of smaller classes was canceled out due to these new wave of teachers not being trained.
 
 Smaller classes can be of great benefit if done correctly. Kids can become smarter and go to college at a higher rate. These benefits can only happen if there is care and consideration. Rushing for smaller classes will only repeat California's mistake.""""",,,,,,,

We Americans have a culture vastly different from any part of the world. We use a different measuring system, tip servers, and have a bunch of idiots sprinkled across our so called great nation. But why do we tip? No other country practices tipping, so why do we? Many people have begun to ask this same question and some companies have begun banning tipping. However when this shift started to occur, many people started to push back and advocate. tipping. So who is right? Should we ban or keep tips? The answer is quite clear. The practice of tipping should cease to exist as it creates a toxic work environment and lowers server's wages.
 Working in customer service is absolute dreadful. Dealing with entitled customers can be emotionally and physically draining. So adding a system that emphasis toxic behavior only makes being a server all more worse. In the text ""How the war on tipping harms customers"" it is mentioned that tipping can discriminate against less attractive servers and the sexual harassment of them. It is also stated that tipping can increase rivalry between servers leading to less cooperation. This accumulation of toxic behavior will absolutely wear down servers. This wear down will lead to poorer service, rather than the assumed better service.
 Not only is a toxic workplace draining, but also a lowered wage. The text mentioned before states ""Opponents of tipping argue it pays workers low and unreliable wages..."". Servers are paid lower wages because employers expect most of their money be made from tipping. However tipping is unreliable as some customers give low or maybe no tip. If servers get low tip then they are being paid way below minimum wage. Sometimes servers get huge tips that outweigh what they would make if they had regular wage. However this amount of tipping is once and a blue moon and most of the time servers are struggling to survive. Putting someone in a situation were their livelihood is uncertain due to greed is terrible.
 Supporters that advocate tipping may argue that tipping helps customers save money. Customers can save money by tipping low or no money and tipping can lead to lower food prices. However are you willing to sacrifice someones livelihood to save a extra bit of money? Also historically dining out at restaurants is supposed to be a luxury, which many people seem to forget. If money is a problem then maybe it's not a good idea to eat at restaurants. They're alternatives that you can take like eating at home or getting fast food. No one is forcing you eat at a place that is supposed to be a luxury. So maybe next time think before you eat.
 Tipping is a archaic system that supports a toxic environment and lowers wages. It dehumanizes servers and makes them go through absolute hell. Tipping can help you save money but at what cost? Its important to remember that these servers you meet at restaurants are human too and deserve respect. They deserve to have a respectable wage that is not unreliable. For now we just have to tip to support the servers, but in the future we need advocate better wage for them.

Some people might think that it wont be effective because of the results with California but everyone will show different results and this could help students in the long run.
 
 The process of reducing classrooms should be well planned out and thought out before so things can be more effective. California rushed to reduce classroom size which is why there was so many negative effects but with the right amount of planning time things can go more smoothly. Tennessee on the other hand had great effects from this experiment and they were even ahead on learning because of how much more controlled it is. For example ""After four years, students in the small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math"". They had a more planned out experiment which showed a more productive learning environment.
 
 Many students benefited from the experiment that was done in Tennessee. Being in smaller classes lad long term effects of the students learning. They continued to do better even after the experiment was done. As seen in the article, ""They continued to d better even after returning to regular sized classes. As the kids grew up, the ones who had been in the small classes graduated from high school and attended college at higher rates"". The size of their class was fundamental to help the students succeed.
 
 There would be more engaged students as well as faster learning process. With less students the teacher is able to focus more on whats needed for individual students which can make students feel fit to be able to engage and do better more. ""Then an experiment in Tennessee in the 1980's plainly showed that students had learned more in classes with fewer students."" This goes to show the results in Tennessee's experiment helps students learn and engage more.
 
 In conclusion, yes classroom size should be reduced it just needs ton be well thought out and planned in advance. If its not thought out enough it can cause many complications. Many people benefited from smaller classrooms in Tennessee's experiment. There will be more engaged students and a faster learning process will be shown. Just because California's results were not the best it doesn't mean that it wont improve other states educational learning.""""",,,,,,,

After reading the article i don't think that tipping should be banned. Lower income people would still like to enjoy being able to eat out and enjoy themselves without worrying about super high prices that are put in place. The overall ratings of restaurants and customer satisfaction would decrease significantly. Also the employees would have a reason to make sure their customer service is top notch with every customer.
 Lower income people would still like to enjoy being able to eat out and enjoy themselves like before. Tipping leaves room for lower menu prices which helps lower income people be able to afford reasonable restaurants and have enough for a tip. Using automatic charging services makes meals and dining experiences more expensive which hurts the lower income customers and doesn't leave them room to actually enjoy their time. As stated in the article, ""Another thing in tipping's favor is that it allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices.."". This allows people to be able to better afford going to eat out.
 The overall rating and satisfaction would decrease significantly. The menu prices would rise which would go from being able to afford the food to leaving them unsatisfied with the cost. The decrease in rating would be related to the pricing or the service. For example, "" I also found that after the switching to the service inclusive pricing, reviewers' comments were more likely to mention tipping, the server or service and price"". Being able to tip helps ensure that the customers satisfaction is met. 
 Keeping customers tipping would have something for workers to think about so the service is able to be the best possible. This will keep employees on their toes to keep them motivated. For example, "".. it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service."" Although I see why the opposition is not for this because the tips will not be given at the same rate for every employee each time but it will be good for them if they offer the best service and they can be rewarded for the tip that they deserve.

To me whether or not someone should tip depends on the service of the waiter or waitress. Some people may not be deciding off service, some people may not need an decision. When it comes to whether or not someone should tip, it's is not always fair. Therefore I thunk tipping should be ban and I can tell you some reasons why.
 The thing about tipping is it always depends on who your servicing and what kind of people they are. Lets say for instance a group of teenagers come in. The whole time their acting out, they order a bunch of food and everything. When it comes time for them to pay, they pay the exact bill and just leave. No tip, they did not straighten up anything just left. Imagine if your restaurant had automatic service charges. You would not have even had to worry about if they tipped or not. Everything that they had just bought would of been accumulated into your check anyways. Imagine the stress that would be taken off your shoulders along with others.
 Many restaurant jobs do not even pay their workers good enough. Especially if its a not so fancy place like Texas Roadhouse. Some people really rely on tips for a higher pay amount on their check. To me the way you look seems to matter a lot in the restaurant industry. Like in the passage it says about tipping it, ""discriminates against less attractive servers as well as servers of color"". This may seem to impact restaurants and their servers a lot. The unfair treatment can cause many of the servers to stress out. Tips should be a reward for your service but instead people are using them against the workers. Customers as well tend to complain about things that are not that serious. This could cause servers to get bad attention and even sometimes fired if their boss seems to turn on them
 In conclusion the unfairness in tipping is unbelievable. There should be no reason why these servers who work hard have to suffer from the selfishness of customers and the way they act. Although if tipping was taken away pay may not be that good that would be better than one worker getting paid more just because they may look better or may be a different skin tone.""""",,,,,,,

It is not only good for the waiters, but plenty of other reasons on to why restaurants ban tipping. Using the text ""How the war on tipping harms customers"", I will explain onto why restaurants should not ban tipping.
 
  Waiters already go through a lot of things. Low incomes, and also unreliable incomes. As discrimination against less attractive servers, skin tone, and harassment of female servers. Being a waiter is already a competitive field as it is. Good service shouldn't be free, and getting a tip. Encourages the waiter to give the customer better service, and satisfaction. If you were a waiter, and gave someone great service. Would you want a tip, or do it for free every time?
 
  Money. The main reason why people don't give tips is because the price is to high for them to give the tip. Tipping allows restaurants to charge a lower for menu prices. Which reduces the cost for eating out, giving them a great opportunity to tip. As it states in the text, ""most consumers in the United States say that they prefer tipping over automatic service charges or inclusive pricing."" Tipping just makes each side, waiter, and customer more comfortable. As well as more preferred. 
 
  Studies. The second study presented was based on 31 independent restaurants from the across the U.S. Both automatic service charges, and service-inclusive pricing caused restaurants to go down in points, regardless of either one. The automatic service charges experienced about a quarter of a point dropping in online rating, and service-inclusive pricing declined in only about 10th of a point. This shows that customers don't like being forced the tip, and less expensive restaurants suffered more then expensive ones.

But, depending on your class size some of those needs may or may not be met. Class size is a big factor in determining if all of a students needs will be met because each teacher needs to help every kid. For students to properly be able to get the help that they need class sizes need to be at a reasonable size, meaning not to big.
 If you went to a public school like I did, most of the the time you will run in to a problem and need the teachers help. You could raise your hand for what feels like forever before you can ask your question. The STAR study helps explain that. A group of researchers studied Tennessee students grades kindergarten-third grade with regular sized classes and smaller class sizes. The study shows that students that had a smaller class size did better and even after they were put back in regular sized classes they were still ahead of the other kids. 
 This happens because teachers have more time to for us when there are less kids so you can spend more time with them individually and help them with their individual needs. However schools donâ€™t always have the extra room for this, just like California. So, this will need to be integrated over time as space is available.

While it can be the luck of a draw of getting a decent tip, it acts as an incentive for servers to give the best dining experience they can. 
 The world has come along way since 2017 it has become a lot more accepting of people in all walks of life. It lets them work for it, to have something to look forward to, and to overall improve service for the customer. Although some people will use race, gender, etc to justify why or why not they will tip most of the time it is truly based off of service quality as found in the study done with Joeâ€™s crab shack.
 Furthermore, they also found that people prefer to tip as opposed to being forced to tip higher than what they feel like the waiter deserves. This overall led to a drop in ratings found in a poll that was conducted.
 This alternate tipping standard will also then raise the price of the meal and not allow for people to afford their food anymore. So, them forcing a higher paying tip will ultimately hurt their servers in the long run. The lessening of business will lead to the lowering of wages for the servers and will lead down a worse path.
 Though it does ensure that they will always get tipped appropriately and not be paid based on tips they may or may not make, they will no longer feel the need to provide the best customer service possible that will then continue to hurt the business. This tipping alternative poses too large of a risk to continue using and restaurants should go back to the traditional tipping method.

Maybe you have had first hand experiences with large classes that were distracting and made it harder for you to get a teacher's attention. Or, you could've had smaller classes that felt more personalized and made it easier for you to learn. Science still doesn't know the dinfintive answer to the best class size that maximizes a student's learning, however, I believe classroom size should be reduced. A study made in 1985, called Project STAR, concluded two key advantages of smaller classrooms: students went on to be more successful and it allowed students to get ahead in school. 
 
 In Project STAR, students in Tennesee schools were assigned to small and large classes at random. The larger classes of about 22 students were used as a control group while the smaller classes of 15 students were the experimental group. The study lasted for over four years and included 11,600 students ranging from kindergarten to third grade, along with 1,300 teachers. The Tribune News Service writes, ""As the kids grew up, the ones who had been in small classes graduated from high school and attended college at higher rates."" The smaller classes had such an impact on the students that they were more likely to get a higher education. In theory, those students could get a higher paying job with a college degree and have a leg up in obtaining a successful life. Besides, most states around the country preach finishing high school and have laws in place that make it harder to drop out. The workforce is beginning to expect workers to have at least a high school diploma or GED, so education is very much needed in everyday life. 
 
 Project STAR also had evidence to suspect that students got ahead in school faster. The Tribune News Serivce reports, ""After four years, students in the small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math."" When students and teachers are exposed to smaller classes, the teachers can easily figure out what a student struggles with. This allows for a more personalized learning experience that will better a studnet's understanding, especially with concepts that are harder for them. It is very easy for students to get ""left behind"" in large classes and they may struggle to catch up once the class moves on. This is detrimental if the concept they don't understand is basic and is needed to be mastered in order to learn other things. When all students are on the same page, classes can advance forward at a quicker pace. 
 
 While Project STAR shows how successful smaller classes are, California had an accidental experiment with decreasing the size of classrooms. The state was looking to get higher test scores but instead they were greeted with a teacher shortage for the new classes along with other grades, makeshift classrooms because there wasn't enough space, and blowing through relatively all of their new money budgeted for schools. In the end, California didn't even receive the positive learning results that they went great lengths to achieve. However, unlike Project STAR, this California program was put together in a rush and was not very well planned out. Most districts had literal weeks to plan for the new school year ahead and gain resources to carry it out. The experiment in Tennesse was planned out and on a smaller scale. While smaller classrooms may not work in certain circumstances, it is important to keep trying until the results are present. After all, mistakes are made all of the time and without them we wouldn't know what to fix in order to improve. The benefits of smaller classrooms are worth making mistakes for until the right plan is created. 
 
 Project STAR was one of the first studies to showcase the benefits of smaller classroom sizes. The study collected evidence to support the fact that students in smaller classrooms were more likely to complete their education and go on to get a college degree. This is a very vital step everyone should take in our modern society as it helps with getting a job in the workforce. The experiment also displayed how advanced the students became after the four years. The personalized learning that was created helped students keep up and have a better understanding of the concepts being taught, thus making the class run smoother and more efficiently. The benefits of reducing class size is vital and should not be overlooked. We've all been students in our lifetimes and have the personal experience to decide for ourselves which class type helped us learn best.

It takes the stress and time away from cooking, and it's a great way to catch up with friends or family. But, with every meal eaten at a restaurant, there usually comes time for someone to pay for the tip. Tips are meant to reward waiters and waitresses for serving you; after all, they were the ones handing out your drinks, food, and making sure you had everything you needed during your meal. The presence of the tip is becoming a controversial topic with it's own complex pros and cons. However, tipping shouldn't be banned in restaurants because inclusive pricing makes meals more expensive and changing the tipping policy has shown to decrease the customer reviews of a restaurant. Tips do more good than harm for employees and businesses.
 
  Inclusive pricing is when menu items are higher in price in order to ensure higher wages can be paid to staff members. While this sounds good in theory, it can be very offputting to customers. Many customers dislike the idea of having to pay a set tip because it can be more costly and it could be rewarding poor service. Tips are meant to be based on performance, so nothing is set in stone. If a server takes a long time to meet demands or outright ignores them when the restaurant is half empty, they are not deserving of the 20% tip. This goes for servers who are inherently rude to customers. On the other end of the spectrum, a server could be doing an amazing job during rush hour and the customer would like to give them more money for their hard work. Without tipping, good service can't be rightfully rewarded and bad service doesn't have monetary consequences. 
 
  Banning tipping outright, or changing the tipping policy can also cause displeasure from customers. A study conducted on Joe's Crab Shacks compared reviews of stores with tipping and no tipping policies. The results indicated that restaurants with tipping were rated higher by about a third of a point. Even if a few customers express problems with a restaurant, it could be enough to affect the business of said restaurant. Word gets around quickly, especially when it comes to food. The loss of business has major negative impacts on employees which include getting laid off. Losing a job causes more financial complications than receiving money from tips ever could cause. It is a complete stoppage of any income. Since businesses with traditional tip policies tend to get better reviews, it is in a restaurant's best interest to continue their tipping policies in order to secure business from customers. 
 
  Some people feel like tipping causes a restaurant to have poor service. Tipping usually attracts younger workers that are inexperienced and servers tend to only care about the money: not their customers. In some cases this can be true, however, restaurants that replaced their traditional tipping policies had more complaints about service in their reviews than restaurants that had normal tipping policies. This comes from the same Joe's Crab Shack study mentioned above. Tips encourage servers to work for their tip. They don't have to bend over backwards to serve, but decency and doing the job correctly is what is expected of them. In turn, they get a little extra cash with each table they monitor. Since servers know this money is on the line, they are more likely to perform their jobs at a greater level than if there was no tip incentive at all. 
 
  Along with encouraging a high performance from severs, tips also make the price of eating out lower for the average customer and doesn't affect reviews of the restaurant in a negative way. Tipping definitely has it's problems, but most of them can be solved if we all understand that you should always tip 20% of the bill unless the service was poor. This amount shouldn't be based on race, looks, or be extremely nit-picky. You may judge servers based on their performance, but they'll judge you based on the amount you tip as a customer.

Tipping will usually help the waiter with keeping their customer service at a higher level because they feel appreciated. At restaurants the workers are paid a wage and they depend on tips. Lastly, customers would rather tip than have a system like service included payment.
 Some believe that tipping leads to "" poorer rather than better customer service and satisfaction."" It's the opposite actually; when you tip your waiter it makes them feel appreciated. When they see that they helped make your meal enjoyable and that you appreciate their hard work they will strive to keep their service at a high level. They will strive to improve their customer service and make it more personal. 
  While tipping might not seem important to you, it can be very important to your waiter/ waitress. Restaurants pay them a wage, so the tips are an extra source of income. That money could be what they need to buy something they need or be needed to pay bills. Your tip to them could help them out in a big way. So even if your service wasn't the best you should still give the waiter a tip because it could make their day better and it just may be what they needed. 
 Service charges or inclusive pricing will usually lower the ratings of the mid - level restaurants. Mid-level restaurants is where tipping is most needed. When you take away tipping and switch it with inclusive pricing, prices of meals go up. You're raising the prices to pay higher wages but doing that brings consequences. Customers at mid-level restaurants aren't going to be willing to pay those higher prices. This means that the restaurant is losing business which leads to less income for the business which means that the workers aren't getting paid as much or are getting laid off. So, there isn't really a good outcome when it comes to inclusive pricing for mid-level restaurants. When you have lower pricing for meals, even the stingier people will give higher tips to the workers. 
 It may be better to have inclusive pricing at higher end restaurants its not for mid- level ones. Some might believe that jobs that offer tips draw unprofessional younger workers who won't be focused. While that may be true in the beginning, those types of workers will learn how important the job is and learn how to service better. Should we ban tipping? No, because most workers at restaurants need those tips. There are more positive outcomes if we keep tipping rather than if we get rid of it.""""",,,,,,,

It's been apart of this type of work for forever so why ban it. The author states that people may tip better because of some workers looks and bodies and that leads into some sexual harassment. I say this is rubbish and opinion based. It is not a fact some people get tipped because of they work ethic and social skills. If their is no tips workers will quit because it will be no money difference between good worker and bad worker. This will make the workers effort lessened because they feel like they're not working for anything except a hourly wage. Also did all his information online and haven`t asked the workers that's actually working. Why would a waiter work all them hours for low wages they cover up the difference with social skills and that earns them tips. Tips are help for workers and that shows them they matter. On the other hand if you take away tipping you will have to inflate the prices which will drive customers away. 
 
 My reason why they shouldn't ban tips at high end restaurants because the inflation of prices. Prices at high end restaurants will go up some percentage because of gratitude for the workers. For example in the text it says "" Restaurants that replaced tipping with automatic service charges experienced about a quarter of a point drop in online ratings, while those that switched to service-inclusive pricing saw a decline of only about a 10th of a point"" so the customers did not like that aspect. I think because of the pricing that later was discussed in this article briefly. Who wants to pay extra tip wages for half services. In the text it discusses that auto tip diners the service went down dramatically. How I know this ? In the text it says ""These findings suggest that displeasure with the no-tipping policy, and with service and prices under that policy, decreased customersâ€™ overall satisfaction with their dining experiences"". It shows that the overall satisfaction has debunked.
 
 Another reason why I say don't ban tips it distinguishes good characters and workers from average. This world is crazy and everybody needs appreciation. So if somebody exceeds their self they deserve extra. Some people working this lucrative to put food on the table for their kids and you going to take this away? Personally I know people live off tips because their hourly pay is shallow it just ends meet. If you depart away from tips you have to up the prices of your food or uplift hourly wages. However, this will take away money from business by losing customers or by paying more for workers.
 
 On the other hand, the author says tips can be introduction into sexual harassment. That's an opinion not an actual fact. Also it can be alleged but that's not a just enough reason to ban tips. Everyone is distinguished through looks so if you get tipped because of your beauty its because of you and you deserve it. But the author says it brings other workers down they can make up the lack luster with more productivity. Some people spend hours in the gym or about their aspect for more money.
 
 The final reason I briefly touched on is wages. Why would you ban tipping if the workers make average wages. The plus with this job is your character and that brings in tips. If take away tips how will these workers make money. It's selfish these people have dreams and futures. Some of them have kids they have to feed and tips can be the factor of their holidays but this author is saying take this away. I know a single mother who paid her kids Christmas with tips. So tipping can be life changing.
 
 In conclusion the tipping matter changed lives and getting rid of is a great disservice. """"",,,,,,,

How do waiters make their money? By earning tips and having a salary. So why would we ban one of their main money earning methods? So, although some may say it pays workers less and promotes discrimination, because it increases customer service and satisfaction while also decreasing menu prices, tipping should not be banned. 
 
 If you earn money relative to how hard you work or how much effort you put into your work. Then it would make sense to work as hard as you can, while pleasing the customer as much as you can. It is a win-win situation, the waiter earns more money and the customer gets better customer service. Look at the crab shack experiment, tipping restaurants were about a third of a point higher than non tipping restaurants. It was not just by chance, it was because they enjoyed their experience more. So why should we get rid of it when it even makes the customers happier.
 
 Another proponent of making the customers happier is cheaper menus. A reason why tipping is so popular is that it is a choice at the end of the day. However higher menu prices are not optional. That may be another reason why tipping crab shack restaurants had better reviews than non tipping restaurants. They were not forced to pay higher menu prices. Although this may lead to people skipping out on tipping more and more, as it is not forced or required. Nonetheless people should have some say in the matter, so tipping should not be banned.
 
 Now, there are some that say tipping leads to lower wages and discrimination. With or without tips, waiters are not making enough to live a comfortable life. So I say wages should be increased even if there is no tipping. Discrimination is always a problem, however i am confident that educated people will judge waiters on their work and not color, sex, or attractiveness. The people that discriminate now, will still discriminate without tips in some way. Removing tips, give the waiters less reason to work harder, and deprive the customers of choice and satisfaction.
 
 In conclusion, tipping is an important part of a waiter's life. That cannot be substituted with higher menu prices, because of customer choice. It makes customers happy and gives waiters a reason to try their hardest on the job. There are plenty of anti-tippers that propose some downsides to tipping, however these downsides are no reason to ban tipping outright. Always remember to tip!

  The tips could be more than what the average person is making. The person could be making minimum wage and a persons tip could really help the employee out. â€œOpponents of tipping argue it pays workers low and unreliable incomesâ€.

  A tip could make the workers day. A person could get tipped a big amount and turn a workers whole day around. Or even a little tip could make the worker smile. Anything could put a smile on the workers face because the worker could probably be broke and working from paycheck to paycheck.
  In differ tipping should be banned. Tipping should be banned because based off how the waiter does he or she may get a tip. Based off how he or she looks she or he may get a tip.

Everyone gave a tip to the waitress and I didnâ€™t really want to because I didnâ€™t have that much cash on me. My friend told me to give a tip and everyone else did, so I ended up giving the waitress a tip.

  i do understand that sometimes people tend to use their total and tip the worker based on their total which totally understandable. tipping is a great way for a worker to make a little extra money on the side of the job . that they are working hard for. people also need to understand that some places they split the tip to all the workers , even though one person work hard of that tip.

Have you felt like that teacher is not focusing on you and giving you the individual attention you need? Have you got to actually know that teacher to where you know you can trust them and talk to them beyond school? If you have answered no to these questions, then you should support the idea that classroom size should be reduced. 
  Classroom size should be reduced, so students can get that engaging and individual learning. With the individual learning, teachers can help focus on that students needs and focus on learning methods. When the classroom size is reduced, the teachers can spend more time on lesson plans for each student to help with content each student doesn't understand. The teachers can understand each students weaknesses and strengths of the content, and they can teach at a good pace. According to studies conducted by RAND (corporation researchers for the Bill and Melinda Gates), in both math and reading, students started below national norms, and then gained ground after one academic year. They then gained further ground the second academic year, placing them above national norms at the end of the two years. This shows with the individual learning of classroom size reduced, students scores had significantly increased.
  Classrooms size should also be reduced because it can allow the teacher and student to actually learn each other. When a teacher learns their student, they are able to know that student's weaknesses and strengths with the content they are teaching. With the student, they able to know that teacher beyond just teaching, and are able to create a relationship with them. This relationship can help that student speak out and know they can tell the teacher when to slow down or just communicate with the teacher better. Evidence shows ""A Review of Educational Research analysis of 46 studies found that strong teacher-student relationships were associated in both the short- and long-term with improvements on practically every measure schools care about: higher student academic engagement, attendance, grades, fewer disruptive behaviors and suspensions, and lower school dropout rates"". This shows with the teacher and student relationship of learning more about each other caused great positive impacts on that student and the overall school.
  The last final reason that classroom size should be reduced is teachers can find coursework fitted for that student. With large classrooms, teachers have to get 30 of the same textbooks, just because its so many of the students and not enough money to get textbooks that students will easily adapt to with their individual weaknesses. With these customized text books for each individual student, they can learn easily and faster to move on to other content. Evidence shows "" One analysis found that elementary school students who used a specific math textbook made larger gains on tests than students who used other books. The impact of switching to a better textbook was comparable to results from a separate California study on the impact of reducing class size by 10 students"". This shows when schools reduced their size and actually used specific textbooks fit for the student, test scores and academic grades had increases.
  On the other hand, classroom sizes being reduced can lead to schools losing lots of money. With reducing sizes, you have to fund for more classrooms and more teachers which is very expensive. Even with the positive side of customized textbooks for students, that will lead to more money being spent. If schools decide to reduce sizes, they need to take money and budgeting into consideration and understand this whole process will take a long time. But if schools, sit down and plan out everything, and understand this will take a long time, then they will have a better chance at succeeding. If they plan, then they can build up funding and save lots of money to pay all the expenses. 
  Overall, classroom sizes should be reduced because it will increase test scores with focused learning and allow teachers to understand and analyze weaknesses and strengths in a student. Classroom sizes reduced can overall positively effect academic of a student and school overall if planned out slowly and carefully. Next time you are in a large class, start a debate up with that class to get their honest opinions and come up with different solutions. Maybe these different solutions can help teachers find different strategies and help the overall school find a different path.""""",,,,,,,

This evidence shows that with tipping, better customer service and satisfaction is received. I also believe with tipping, workers are given the motivation to improve on their service to get more tips in the future. 
  Lower menu prices is the last reason why I believe restaurants shouldn't ban tipping. With tipping, restaurants are able to lower wages, which leads to lower menu prices. Using the article, ""Should restaurants ban tipping"", allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices, which stingier tippers like because it reduces the costs of eating out"". This evidence shows that with tipping, lower menu prices are increased and I believe even the stingier tippers will improve their tipping as well. 
  On the other hand, restaurants should ban tipping because it pays low wages and because it puts pressure on the customers. Tipping gives owners another reason to lower wages , just because of the idea of ""tipping"" in their mind is another source of wealth. Tipping also pressures people to tip, when its maybe their last dollar and last to give. This can cause people to not return or bad reviews. But, tipping is also a choice in certain places, and the decision is ultimately up to you. If those restaurants do require tipping, then simply go to another affordable restaurant. 
  Overall, tipping shouldn't be bad because it can increase customer service and satisfaction. Tipping can also allow lower menu prices. Also, in the end tipping is a choice in certain places, and with that the decision is all up to you. Thank you. """"",,,,,,,

In classrooms with a larger amount of students, it can become more difficult to get the help that you need to understand the content being taught. Classroom sizes should be reduced for many reasons. Reducing the sizes of classrooms comes with many benefits such as the availability of the teacher, students learning more throughout a school year, and the increase in success rates. Some might believe that reducing the sizes of classrooms is a bad idea because it makes it harder to find the needed space for all of the classes or because it is harder to find enough educators but if you don't rush the process of changing the classes then you can take the time to find educators and space. for the classes. 
 One reason that classroom sizes should be reduced is because the availability of the teacher increases with the less amount of students in a class. There are many benefits to having a teacher with a small class. When the teacher is trying to teach something in a large classroom and multiple students have questions about what is being taught, it makes it more difficult for the teacher to help everyone and answer their questions. With a reduction in classroom sizes, students can get their questions answered and get explanations from their teachers so that they can better understand the content being taught. With thorough explanations and answers provided by the teachers, students will be more likely to remember the content and succeed in what they are learning. 
 Another reason that classroom sizes should be reduced is the change in the amount of content that students can learn within a school year. With a reduced class size, teachers can help students quicker which leads to them understanding the content quicker. Since students can learn the content quicker with the help of their teachers, they can move on to new content quicker. At the end of the school year this can lead to the students coming out ahead of classes with a larger number of students. Tennessee schools did an experiment called Project STAR where they compared results of regular sized classes with about 22 students and small classes with about 15 students. After four years of the experiment, the students in small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math. If class sizes were reduced, teachers could teach more content in each year providing more information for the students to become successful.
 A third reason that classroom sizes should be reduced is the increase in success rates. In Project STAR, the students who were placed in reduced size classes and came out months ahead of the other students continued to better when they returned to regular-sized classes. As these students grew up, those who were in the reduced size classes graduated from high school and attended college at higher rates. These students were placed in reduced size classes which made the teacher more available allowing them to learn more throughout the school year which led to them becoming successful all throughout school. Them being successful all throughout school prepared them to be successful in life. 
 Overall, placing students in reduced size classrooms allows them to learn more making them more successful. To successfully reduce the class sizes, school have to slowly transform into them, they can't rush the process. California tried their own experiment like Project STAR but they didn't get the results that Tennessee did. California rushed into the experiment without planning out where to put new classrooms or where to get enough teachers for all of the classes. Would you prefer being in a larger class or reduced size class?""""",,,,,,,

Reasons why restaurants should not ban tipping are that business have tried previously and it didn't work and customers seem to prefer tipping over inclusive pricing. In the text, the author mentions businesses that went from tipping to inclusive pricing but satisfaction ratings dropped causing the businesses to switch back to tipping, such as Joe's Crab Shack. After looking at the findings of the author, he concluded that, ""These findings suggest that displeasure with the no-tipping policy, and with service and prices under that policy, decreased customersâ€™ overall satisfaction with their dining experiences."" When it came to the diners preferences, they preferred tipping because of how inclusive changed the business. In the text it states, ""The studyâ€™s data do not tell me why service charges decreased ratings more than did inclusive-pricing, but I suspect that it was because consumers hate being forced to tip more. Higher prices, on their own, are less objectionable."" If customers wanted to pay a higher price, they would more likely feel comfortable doing it because they want to and not because of the business. In the text it also states, ""Another interesting finding from the second study was that the negative impact of getting rid of tipping was related to how pricey or cheap the restaurant was. That is, less expensive restaurants suffered a greater hit to their ratings relative to classier joints."" This means that at classier places you expect higher prices so the inclusive prices wouldn't surprise you as much as if you were at a cheaper place. 
 Some might believe restaurants should ban tipping because it would make the customers more comfortable not having to worry about how much to tip. There would also be no discrimination on the server. However, studies show that depending on the status of the restaurants people prefer to tip instead of pay inclusive prices. """"",,,,,,,

It can also depend on the students that are placed in a smaller class size, some students might prefer a larger class. Switching to smaller class sizes can be much harder on the schools than they think. In the article it mentions California schools starting with an average class size of 29. It also states, ""Some schools had classes with more than 30 students and needed to make enough classrooms for 20 or fewer."" This caused a drastic change in schools. To shrink class sizes, you need more classrooms, most of which were unavailable because there were no other rooms in the schools. Portable classrooms for all the schools cost $300 million more than what they were given. California schools were then in debt from this drastic switch that happened very fast. The article mentions using space from gyms,cafeterias, and even playgrounds in order to hold a class. After the $500 million change, they had to find teachers to teach these new classes. This created a teacher shortage. Teacher from higher grades were brought to the younger students, they even had to use teachers who have not yet finished their requirements. This made it even harder for the students to learn. Smaller class sizes might lead to higher test scores, which is very good for bother the school and students. However, it is not worth teacher and classroom shortages.""""",,,,,,,

When you go out to eat it is customary and normally expected that you tip 20% of the bill to the waiter/waitress. When looking at tipping at restaurants, a lot of factors can be taken into consideration. Tips can show how good or bad a waiter/waitress is doing while at work. Tips encourage these workers to always give their best rather than busting and doing more than what they were originally told in the job interview. It can also creat room for an employee to get harassed by a customer but have the issue pushed aside because they received a good tip. Tips are a very controversial topic and need to be looked into. 
 Tips strongly encourage workers to do their very best as they never know what someone may tip. They might receive $10-$30 just from one person. This also provides a better look for the restaurant seeing as you are more likely to return to a place you really liked. Good food, good service, and receiving youâ€™re food and drink fast are going to encourage one to return. This builds the restaurant as well as the economy. If we were to stop tipping, why would the employees continue to work as hard? They would only receive their given wage and they probably already know how much their next check will be. No extra money means no extra work to the bulk of society. This, in return, pushes people away from the restaurant and leaves a lack of workers.
 On the other hand, tipping allows many customers to believe they can treat these workers however they want just because they will leave a big tip. That might be okay to people because they are making money but it leaves a bad image in the minds of the children around us. They see these working being harassed and discriminated but then see their parents leave them extra money as an excuse to bring the worker down. This teaches the next generation that it is okay to discriminate people just because they are working for money and are forced to be nice to the customer. Getting rid of tipping, can and will encourage these employees to stand up for themselves rather than letting this behavior happen. 
 Tipping can also show the employer which workers he needs to train a little more and which should train others. Bad service will not lead to a good tip. Therefore a less than stellar waiter/waitress might not receive as big of tip as a great waiter/waitress. 
 Tipping is left up to you. Empathy is a key in tipping, imagine how you feel in their shoes. Would you prefer to receive a nice tip from your hard work? Would you be okay without a tip because of how you believe it effects the employee? Itâ€™s all up to the customer. """"",,,,,,,

When there is fewer kids in classroom it would be easier for someone to be able to get one on one help from the teacher if needed. If there was less students they would probably be more comfortable to raise there hand and ask a question. If you were to reduce classroom size though I would say you needed to transition into it slowly so that the teachers no what to expect.
  When there is fewer kids in the classroom it would be easy for a kid struggling with what there learning to get help. In the text it says ""Then an experiment in Tennessee in the 1980's plainly showed that students had learned more in classes with fewer students."" Being the kids had fewer classmates they were able to get help when needed and move through topics and go into depth with what they were learning and learned so much more.
  Less students in the classroom would probably make some kids comfortable to actually raise their hand and ask a question. With less kids they might be able to get to know each other better. This would make it where kids feel like they could answer and ask questions. Also maybe just with there being less kids even if they didn't get close it less kids so they feel like they can really participate in class.
  I think before reducing to smaller classes you have to help the teachers get prepared for it. The teachers will probably have to come up with a new method of teaching. With giving the teacher a new method of teaching then reducing the class so that they are prepared for whats to come.
  These are the reasons i think the classes should be reduced to smaller size. I think we would learn so much more in our classes and help if we really needed it from our teachers.

Coming from my point of view as a student I really don't think big classes are for me based off on being in small classroom once. Also there would be more room to learn things quicker depending which class you was put in and if you can keep up. I know there can be downfalls to smaller class switch like California, but they just wasn't ready because they rushed into it and where they could've did controlled groups like Tennessee the outcome could have been totally different.
 One of the reasons I said yes to the classroom size reduction is as the point of view as student I think we should have more opinion on how we learn things and how we want to learn. Me being in a big class most time don't always help me focus because I am either distracted by the fact my friends are in the classroom, or other students who have their friends in the class with them so they talk and talk and keep going which is distracting. The experiment could be people who want to volunteer to be in a smaller classroom if they wanted to.
 The experiment in Tennessee was successful because they had the money and the teacher willing to help them get this project done. I mean California was kinda successful but you really can't tell because you don't know if they students did good later on. Tennessee took the time to see if they would like to start the project and gave time for he project to develop and California just rushed right into it.
 The problems with California is that it was more of a rushed to which where they jumped right into something they didn't prepare for because of the recent test scores of 4th graders from there. They was out here rushing to see if this could work for them because of Tennessee success rate. They were looking for teachers and they needed some money to expand the classroom which they had to get which was fast so basically it could've been a whole lot better if they took there time to see if they want that to get test scores up.
 I see where some people are coming from by saying no to class size reduction because of California outcome but that doesn't mean it's always true for everybody state.

Well, you're right, with reduced classroom sizes, comes many benefits, here are a couple; first, reduced class sizes will allow the teacher to center their attention on fewer students. Second, reduced class sizes will help to improve test-scores. Third, reduced classes can have a positive impact on students later down the road. These are just some of the reasons why classroom size should be reduced to help facilitate more learning in classrooms.
 
 Reduced class sizes allows teachers to center their attention on less students. Having less students, means the teacher has more time to give personal feedback on assignments, quizzes, and tests. Additionally, this makes it more easy for students to personally talk with their teachers or ask for help. Also, when raising your hand in class, the teacher may take a couple minutes to come help the student, and that student may become discouraged and put their hand down and not ask for the help they may need. Making personal feedback more accessible to the student will help to point out problems in their work. 
 
 Next, reduced class sizes can help with test-scores. Project STAR, an experiment in Tennessee shows the results of a program that works. In the text, it says ""After four years, students in the small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math,"" these are spectacular results! With these students being so far ahead than their peers, they improved overall test-scores. The students were most likely so far ahead because of the teacher's focus on less students, Project STAR had clearly shown that smaller classes were better.
 
 Finally, smaller classes can have a large impact on students. In the STAR program, the students that were in the smaller classes, even after they were returned to normal-sized classes, they still continued to do better than their peers. Also, with the same students, they graduated school and attended college at greater rates than the students in the regular-sized classes. The smaller classes can give students much more confidence with less peers around, ending the ""fear of being wrong"" in front of the class. Besides, there's been many times in class where I have not raised my hand just because I thought I would be wrong, but then not understanding why the answer is what it is.
 
 On the other hand, in California, the CSR Program, aimed at reducing class size to match results with Project Star failed to bear any similar results with Project STAR could show that reducing class sizes may not be very beneficial. It's easy to think that this program just ""failed,"" but if you take a look at what actually happened, many faults can be pointed out. The biggest problem with CSR was that it was rushed, in the text it says, ""School administrators had just a few frantic weeks to rewrite class lists, revise schedules, hire more teachers, create new classrooms, and get more equipment."" This lead to all sorts of problems, such as inexperienced teachers and insufficient classrooms. Reducing the classroom size will lead to good results, as long as the transition to the smaller class is done smoothly and slowly.
 
 In conclusion, classroom sizes should be reduced to help facilitate more learning in classrooms. This is because it will improve test-scores, allow the teacher to center their attention on less students, and they have positive impacts on students later in life. Although there has been failed attempts at reducing class sizes, such as the CSR program in California, it doesn't mean we should just throw this out the window, if a smooth transition happens like Project STAR in Tennessee, you will get remarkable results. This will take time, but if done correctly, will be life-changing for future students in school.""""",,,,,,,

How was your experience with tips? If not, have you ever tipped at a restaurant? What do you think of tipping? The article ""How the war on tipping harms customers"" by Michael Lynn describes how tipping is controversial, where in some places tipping has been replaced with alternatives such as automatic service charges and inclusive pricing. There is also the debate on whether tipping actually benefits or hurts customers, and if it benefits or hurts workers. The practice of tipping should not be banned in favor for other alternatives. This is for the reason that the alternatives cause poorer customer satisfaction and lower ratings of restaurants.
 
 Compared to tipping, automatic service charges and inclusive pricing cause lower ratings at restaurants. Evidence that shows are the restaurants who switched from tipping to an alternative began having a decrease in ratings. The Crab Shack Experiment shows exactly this, where Lynn states: ""I found customers rated Joeâ€™s Crab Shack restaurants higher â€“ by about a third of a point on a five-point scale â€“ when they operated under tipping than when they used service-inclusive pricing."" The evidence shows how when the restaurant operated with tipping, it had higher ratings compared to when it operated with the alternative. Another piece of evidence of why tipping should be favored over the alternatives is that customers are more satisfied with tipping. Lynn states: ""I also found that after switching to service-inclusive pricing, reviewersâ€™ comments were more likely to mention tipping, the server or service and price. Moreover, these comments were generally associated with lower ratings."" This statement shows that when customers learned that tipping was not an option, and instead they received higher costs for their meal, they became upset with it. 
 
 Some argue that tipping actually leads to poorer customer satisfaction. This is for the belief that it ""detracts"" from the customer dining experience. I don't think this is true because I believe customers would be more displeased if they found out they had to pay higher prices for their meal. So no, it doesn't lead to poorer customer satisfaction, tipping has been widely used for a long time, so that's what people are expecting to do after they finish their meal. What more likely would leader to poorer customer satisfaction, is higher prices for the food caused by alternatives to tipping, since people would be expecting to tip instead of having other charges added onto their meals. In the end, we can see why tipping is better than it's alternatives, such as automatic service charges and inclusive pricing, because tipping leads to higher customer satisfaction and restaurant ratings, since customers do not like the alternatives.

 When it comes to tipping in restuarants it's what gives the workers there satisfaction with how they're doing and inspires them to work harder for better tips. Said in the passage ""Some also believe that it leads to poorer rather than better customer service and satisfaction. Thatâ€™s because it supposedly attracts younger, part-time and less professional workers to tipped occupations, undermines serversâ€™ intrinsic motivations to care for their customers, discourages service enhancing teamwork among servers and encourages discrimination in service delivery against customers believed to be poor tippers."" This evidence from the text shows how tipping workers can impact how they think and how they work by doing there job. Tipping customers also is that it pays the workers there. 
 Last reason people should tip the workers is because when it comes to built in tips some at some resturants people who eat there don't want to tip. 2 key pieces of evidence says that ""Another interesting finding from the second study was that the negative impact of getting rid of tipping was related to how pricey or cheap the restaurant was. That is, less expensive restaurants suffered a greater hit to their ratings relative to classier joints."" This shows that places that serve low priced food usually don't get tipped as often with the built in tip that they can do. But with more wealthier customers it says that ""It may also explain why most of the restaurants experimenting with different tipping policies are moderately to very expensive. Their wealthier customers, who are less sensitive to the added costs of service charges or inclusive-pricing, are less likely to punish them."" This just shows how tipping with a built in tip that if you work somewhere that isn't that wealthy the chances of you either getting a tip at all or a low tip is quite high.
 And other may argue that paying the wokrers there more and having the option to tipping. Even with that being a good idea becuase their pay wouldn't fluxuate every paycheck it also doesn't give them the strive to be better workers for them to work for something.

 In Project STAR's results, it showed that the students put in small classrooms were improving drastically. Students were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math, and continued to do much better, even after the experiment was over. This proves that the project was a success.
 Project STAR, however, was a controlled experiment. It was taken slow and steady, and they carefully organized it to make sure everything was going well. California's failed experiment was rushed and carelessly executed, and ended up failing because of it. Most of the kids either had no improvement or were hurt by the experiment. 
 California had several problems that they didn't notice until they began this experiment. The most notable problems, and the main reason the experiment went poorly, was the shortage of teachers, classrooms, and money, and the amount of students they actually had in the schools. They weren't prepared to handle a massive project such as this and when they rushed into it, they put themselves in a bad position.
 Project STAR and California's program both showed that there is a certain way we can go about the small classes experiment so that it will work. They should take it slow and make sure they are well prepared with the resources and funds to actually make it work. The California program taught us that a rushed project will end in failure, but the project can work if it is done right.

Tipping is a way to attract more competent workers with better customer service, and motivates them to deliver better service. Taking this away would take away that motivation, and customer service, and ratings as a result, would decrease.
 Tipping also allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices. This means that eating out is cheaper, which would increase the amount of customers and tips the restaurant receives. Tipping gives the customers a way to eat cheap and reward the restaurant in return.
 Some restaurants are trying to find alternatives to tipping, with things like automatic service charges and service-inclusive pricing. They believe that it is better than tipping, and will help solve the social problems restaurants face. While they each have their own benefits, they are not as well-received as tipping is. Many restaurants that replaced tipping with an alternative received drops in their online ratings and negative comments increased.

 Classroom sizes should be reduced because students have have had a large positive impact on their learning. In the article, it states that ""After four years, students in the small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math"". This shows that reduced classroom sizes do actually effect students and their way of learning in a positive way.

 Reduced classes can also help your students become better prepared for the future. The article says that "" As the kids grew up, the ones who had been in small classes graduated from high school and attended college at higher rates"". This statement is a prime example of how smaller classes are more effective than regular classes. The STAR project has really given an idea on what is best for students.
 
 Some people are worried about the project because they didn't see much improvement on students.. The article says that ""Unfortunately, these huge efforts didnâ€™t result in big leaps of learning for students. Californiaâ€™s program resulted in only small increases in learning, at least in the early years. Some groups of students didn't benefit at all"". California had some issues with the project mainly because their school system was much more larger than Tennessee's.

Instead of just paying the tip, many establishments have started charging for the service. It's also widely perceived that tipping detracts from the customer experience. However, I learned that it actually enhances it. Supporters of tipping say it helps workers get by. Critics of tipping say it undermines the dignity of low-paid workers and encourages better customer service. 
 
 Some believe that it undermines the intrinsic motivations of servers to provide good customer service. It also encourages discrimination against customers who are believed to be poor tippers. On the other hand, supporters of the practice claim that it increases customer satisfaction and loyalty. They also point out that it helps attract more skilled workers. The article states that ""Customers who tip at Joes Crab Shack restaurants were more likely to rate the establishments higher than those who didn't. This effect was most likely caused by the fact that they were more willing to pay for their food."" This establishes that customers who ordered at Joes Crab Shack restaurants rated them higher than when they were not tipping.
 
 Another reason tipping shouldn't be banned is because it can help cut costs and save the customers money. The best thing to do if you want to receive a tip is to make sure that they spend as little as possible(plus great service). That article states that ""Another thing in tippingâ€™s favor is that it allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices, which stingier tippers like because it reduces the costs of eating out."" That explains that tipping wouldn't be a big problem if the cast of food was lower.
 
 Finally, tipping should be allowed because it gives the customer more control over their experience. When dining in a restaurant , some people complain about the pressure tipping causes. It can also make the experience much better because it makes the server more motivated to help and serve better. 
 
 Most people believe that tipping can cause negative impacts on customers and coworkers. People will put the idea that them paying a tip with ""okay"" service will make them feel like they have been cheated. That problem will cause low reviews and will cause less customers. 
 
 Tipping has became a stable hospitality industry.

The passage says that when California heard about how the Project star showed brilliant results for those students that were selected they immediately wanted to integrate it into their school system but like i said it was randomized so they expected to have the same outcome but no they didn't want to gradually in cooperate it into their learning system.

 When you think about there are plenty of jobs where servers are payed tips and they either are working for those tips to pay college, pay bills, take care of children, or to even save up for minor things they need for basic necessities like a car or household things. Also in the article being a serve as said they could be sexual harassed and they have to put up with a lot more than the average or for those employees of color may not get as many tips but they add up its all about principle. The article also brings up how there are younger crowd of workers and those tips could give them the opportunity to make a little more for themselves and they love the thought of even though i'm getting paid this i also get tips to look forward to.
 Now to justify my answer in the article it say that ""On the other side of the debate, proponents of tipping claim it increases rather than decreases customer service and satisfaction. Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service."" I agree with this statement so much because people feel like if you give off good service than they are fine with giving you money and sometimes the money could be way bigger than you think and people live off that and that attracts people with a good attitude and customer service and it attracts customers and when they feel like you give off good vibes they are most likely to come back and tell friends and family about how they enjoyed themselves and that bring ins more customers.
 Now i will say this there are a lot of things that make sense with the other argument like the article talks about how there are some people who feel like they don't need to pay a tip or just don't want to have to give the extra money for someone doing their job but at the end of the day waitresses and other servers that get tips make probably a little less than everyone else and people give thanks for your generosity and for money people would continue to keep doing a good job especially if it brightens someone else day. 
 In conclusion i think the tip policy shouldn't be changed and people should get paid tips.

Do you feel your students are comfortable with their learning environment.? Is the volume of the classes decreasing your instruction time? Well your answers to these questions may be finding another alternative. The biggest alternate may simply be adjusting to smaller classes. Reducing classroom sizes can have a positive effect on student learning.
 
  
  Smaller classes give students many advantages academically and also higher results in student achievement. Research shows that students in smaller classes perform better in all subjects and on all assessments when compared to their peers in larger classes. In smaller classes students tend to be ahead of other classes in content knowledge. They score higher on standardized tests. According to Project Star , a randomized controlled experiment, that asked a range of students from kindergarten to the third grade whether they would learn in a classroom with fewer children in it. Over a total of four years they randomly placed teachers and students into two groups in 80 Tennessee schools. The control group is the regular sized group which had about 22 students and the treatment group which was the smaller class had 15 students . After the 4 years the results from the smaller class were tremendous. They noticed that students were months ahead and reading and math. On top of that they even continued to do better when they went back to learning in regular sized classes. Eventually when the kids got older they graduated high school and went to college with high test scores. 
 
 
  The relationship between students and teachers in smaller classrooms may have a better outcome. If there are less kids in a classroom teachers would simply have more time to cover any material that needs to be taught . Also teachers would have more flexibility to use different instructional approaches. Some students just simply need to learn more than one way to do something and they canâ€™t do that because itâ€™s just to many kids in one setting . On top of that the amount of stress on teachers to not be able to teach their students effectively. Teachers need to identify specific problems that each student may have to be effective. In large classes , this may be hard for many educators . Not because they are wrong but simply because they don't have the resources to do. Students' academic achievements more than likely rises in small class sizes because teachers have the ability to offer students with more personalized instruction. The relationship that a student has with its teacher can affect the way the student learns. The quality of the teacher also matters. In 1996 California passed a legislation called the CSR program that gave schools money to reduce kindergarten to third grade classes to 20 students or fewer. The school administration had only a few weeks to prepare for school and most importantly hire new teachers to teach their students. They had to hire 18,000 new teachers the first year of the program. They hired teachers from other states , moved teachers to different grades, and many schools had to hire teachers without experience or even teachers who hadnâ€™t even finished the requirements. This is one of the reasons that their efforts to reduce small classes didnâ€™t give them the results that they wanted . Teachers' experience matters. . In California having experienced teachers wiped out the benefits of being in a small class . Students depend on teachers to learn. So basically having small class sizes, with qualified teachers , benefits the students because individual attention is effectively developing skills .
  Students being in smaller classrooms can encourage participation. It has been proven that students are more likely to learn faster and perform better. A class size of fewer than 20 students often results in more individual attention, increased participation, and better communication between the instructor and students. There is more incentive for students to pay attention and become more involved in a small class, because it is very obvious when they donâ€™t. Since students feel more motivated to participate in a small class , they tend to get more out of it . Studentâ€™s are able to share their ideas and ask questions about topics they donâ€™t understand.
 
 
  Some might say that smaller class sizes aren't effective for student learning. Which may be true in some cases. Many researchers have debated for years on whether reducing class room sizes actually benefit students. Project Star and CSR program are both prime examples of how reducing class sizes benefited student learning and how it didn't. Project Star which was an experiment in the 1980â€™s showed how students learned more effectively in classes with fewer students. California was inspired by Project Star due to their schools' bad test scores . That rushed to shrink classes, things didnâ€™t turn out as expected. The difference between these two experiments is Project Star was better planned than the CSR program. All of the Star Tennessee schools had enough space to adjust to smaller classes. On the other hand Californiaâ€™s schools struggled to find space . Schools had classrooms with more than 30 students in them and had to take space away from the gym, libraries, and even cafeteriaâ€™s. Another big difference between the two is that California just simply didnâ€™t have enough money to cover all the costs. Most school districtâ€™s had to find additional funding to pay teachers or spaces . Money that wouldâ€™ve usually been spent on repairs , learning materials, and training for teachers were spent on adjusting to smaller classes.
 
 
  Reducing classroom sizes isnâ€™t guaranteed to be 100 percent effective or guaranteed to work, but donâ€™t knock until you try it. For instance if youâ€™re considering adjusting to fewer students in your classroom. Take your time , no need to rush . Use Californiaâ€™s CSR program as an example of what not to do. Take time in finding space in the school buildings so that you have enough classrooms and resources. Find qualified and experienced teachers that will have a positive impact on students ability to be successful.. Most importantly make sure you or your school district has the proper funds to make this big adjustment. If you try it and you donâ€™t see positive results . It is okay . Just know that reducing small class sizes is an option that can help your students learn better.

According to the article â€œ Should restaurants ban tips â€œ it states Another thing in tippingâ€™s favor is that it allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices, which stingier tippers like because it reduces the costs of eating out. This is good because if restaurants are lowering meal prices , which means food is becoming cheaper .Than maybe people can afford to give more tips to their servers. 
 
 
 Some may argue that although tipping adds up to good pay but it causes inconsistent earnings . They are right . Since tips are basically extra money . Paychecks and money will not be the same every time . As a restaurant worker they are more than likely well aware of that . So this gives serves more encouragement and determination to provide good quality service to make and receive more tips .

At more high end restaurants, the tips go alot farther as more rich people reside in restaurants like these, giving workers even more money for their work. If the problem is the workplace itself, that it not the problem of the worker, businesses inherently have a problem with low pay at the moment and the solution to this problem isn't to get rid of tipping. I do believe the experimenting done to reach the conclusion of lower reviews should be further pursued as the results were not nearly thorough enough. With that being said, most people working at dine-in places and restaurants are doing it to make money, not entirely because they want to work at a dine-in restaurant. If someone wanted solely to work at a dine-in restaurant it would be smarter to work at a fancier one anyway. That being said, a counter to this belief is that the presence of tipping puts unnecessary pressure on the customer to give a good tip, that's entirely individual and based on the person, and someone who feels pressure and gives into it should be an adult if they're eating at a dine-in restaurant and paying thus meaning they should be aware of the decision they're making.

While in class, it can be hard to learn or focus on some days, whether that be because you're simply tired, or because there's too much going on in your life. However, it's much easier to focus in the class when there aren't as many students, lots of noise or distractions can cause a student to lose focus and not learn anything. Classrooms should be reduced because, teachers and students typically can learn more in a year, and put the students farther ahead than others in their grade. Though, these might sound like good reasons to reduce the size, there are always reasons why you shouldn't. 
 Around 1985, Project STAR was born and held a randomized controlled experiment with students in kindergarten through the third grade. They had two specific groups, half of the students were put into smaller classes, with less people, and the other half was put into regular size classes. Both groups were tested and monitored to see how they each learnt, and how fast as well. The experiment lasted four years, and it was very obvious in the end that classes with fewer students had a larger impact on the students. In the article, it states ""..students in the small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math."" Being in a smaller class, especially as a child, is more efficient and easier for the child. With lots of children and only one teacher, it can be hard to keep all 22-26 kids awake and paying attention. I believe classrooms should be reduced, especially for kids that need more interactions to keep them learning.
 Project STAR concluded that the students in their experiment, would continue to learn better compared to the regular-size classes. When kids learn more in their previous year, it typically helps them for next year, whether that's in reading or in math. It can be very important for a child to be prepared for their next year of school, and definitely easier on the teacher. The experiment proved that in a small classroom, can provide less distractions and that when growing up, the children attended college at higher rates. If I was given the option to be in a small classroom, I would chose to take it, learning more and learning faster is better than having to wait for everyone else to learn the same thing as you.
 However, there are always disadvantages when it comes to a controlled experiment. After Project STAR had released their results, lots of other places and schools wanted to try the same thing. In California, they had an average of 29 students in each class, while in the experiment their high average of students were only about 22 students. That is a big amount of difference, it would be easier to conduct an experiment there than it would be in California. When shrinking a classroom, it means you need more classes or more teachers, for more room to learn. Hiring more teachers means more money, and to have more room for the students, you have to spend more money for them to do so. In California, they spent nearly $1 billion in the first year alone, which is way more money than they expected to spend. Being able to learn in a small classroom can be very beneficial to the students and teachers, however it may not work for everyone and every school. It takes a lot of money to shrink classrooms so quickly, and to change everything about their schools. 
 In the end, I believe its worth the money and worth the time consuming to reduce classrooms. Even if it takes time, class should have fewer students, its easier for the children to pay attention and grow more while learning. Better test scores and grades are important, and students opinions should be taken account for. """"",,,,,,,

Recently however, many people have suggested the abolition of restaurant tipping, and instead the tip would automatically come from the bill. Rather than a customer deciding how much they would like to tip their server, or if they want to tip at all. This policy has brought up a lot of attention, and has been used in a few restaurants, mostly high-end places. The study has shown that places where tipping is an automatic service, customer reviews have gone down. I believe that restaurants shouldn't ban tipping because, many servers get a lot of their money from tips and some work really hard for them. It would be unfair to tip everyone equally if one server barely does any work, or is rude to customers. With an automatic tipping system, you'll have to tip your terrible server regardless, which could cause a lot of problems for both sides. Tips are like a reward for service, and with receiving good tips as a server, the author states ""..motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service."" Servers who are receiving tips based on their performance are more likely to try harder, and do a better job. This explains how bad automatic tipping systems can be, a worker will work hard and act nicely for the chance of a high tip, but when a server already knows that a percentage of the bill will go to their tip, they might care less. Service can get bad or lousy, because what's the point of working hard when you'll know you'll get paid extra anyways? Ratings may go down in restaurants with this tipping system, which leads me to my second evidence. The restaurant Joe's Crab Shack started using the automatic tipping system, and across the country the menu prices went up because tipping was now included. The author used data from ReviewTrackers, to track how well service has now been and from his data, he included that ratings did indeed go down. Customer service went down around a quarter of a point drop, because these servers must have been doing worse of a job. There could be many factors besides the customer service in these ratings, but the author couldn't conduct that kind of experiment. Included tipping, in my opinion does more harm than good, but tipping would now be a lot easier. Instead of having to find a few bucks in your wallet after your service, or trying to do the math in your head wondering how much is 20% of your bill. Included tipping services offer an easier way to tip your server, there's no need to worry. However, though tipping may be easier, you won't have the chance to change the tip. What if my service was bad and I want to take a few dollars off? Or what if my service was way better than I expected and wanted to add a few dollars? There's no system, and there's no way of telling how much or how less someone may get. Service could get worse, workers may work less and customers won't come back. Servers should earn their tips, and the only way to do so would be by working hard and hoping your customer tips you well.""""",,,,,,,

Another argument the article states is,"" Some also believe that it leads to poorer rather than better customer service and satisfaction.

By doing this kids would have more opportunities in school to get higher scores. Kids would probably feel more comfortable to have a voice in the class as well . Lastly by reducing class sizes you are giving more room for those to have less distraction and and more stable classroom environment. By doing these things to better accommodate students you would be more inclined to see better results than the normal average in students but rather the above average.
 
  Higher scores, this is the goal for all schools so why not implement it by doing what is best and needed. In the super-STAR experiment they did a controlled and treated group experiment to actually test the thought, and results showed that students were in fact doing better in small classes. The students showed that ""After four years, students in the small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math."" The author did say they returned to normal sized classes but ""class size mattered, and it mattered a lot."" It mattered because it set the structure on learning better and faster. I will say that when California tried to implement the new structure they failed, but not because its a bad technique and way of learning but because they didn't prepare the right way and control the new idea. As well as rushed things without a set plan and layout of how it was going to happen with the low research. in conclusion higher score can and have been achieved through the smaller classes technique, when controlled and handled appropriately. 
 
  Teachers goal should be to create an environment where students should feel comfortable and at ease to share there ideas and know they will get an opinion back that shouldn't be fogged by a loud full disruptive class. This can be resolved easily by... smaller classes, and give students more room. in the class to know they can have the teachers full attention or at least more then if there was a full room of kids. There isn't a quote to back it up, but it is mentioned in the opening sentence and can be used as ""evidence""bc it should be obvious and frankly common sense to know that by having a smaller class you are giving more room for attention and honest opinion an advice. Attention from a teacher is something a lot of kids look at when in a new class. Students want to be fully acknowledged and respected and to do that a teacher needs to be able to focus on the students at hand with full awareness. 
 
 
  When all students do is talk through instruction or mess around nothing can get done. If a class gets nothing done then scores will not raise and schools will not move anywhere up the ""chain"" to be better and continue to be ""mediocre"". In the text the rates of of students from smaller classes graduating and going to college were so much higher than most. The quote to follow is summed up above but ca be backed up with this...""As the kids grew up, the ones who had been in small classes graduated from high school and attended college at higher rates."" With this being my last point I hope it backed up the point as needed. 
 
  Students need structure and to build structure you need to terminate the things that are causing a negative space.The future of those who are having to learn and rely on their scores to carry them to the future they want need an environment that they can thrive in and not settle.So without 
  larger classes students are proven to get higher scores , comfortability in a classroom, an more attention that is owed to young minds. So YES classrooms should be size reduced in my opinion. """"",,,,,,,

Tipping is a traditional thing in the industry. People are used to being able to give tips to the workers that they feel deserve them. The tip is an incentive too give good customer service. But the minimum wage in the industry is $2.13. That wage is laughably unlivable. But the idea is that the worker gets tipped and that money is theirs so it makes up for it. 
 The problem with tips is that they are not certain. Just because you get served doesn't mean that you will be tipping. The worker is only getting $2.13 (if paid minimum) for the hour whether or not they get a tip or they don't get a tip. That means that if a restaurant has a slow day then the worker will likely not get as much money as they were used to for the day. If the business has slow days for a year, then that worker will see a drastic drop in their pay. The wage they are guaranteed is really low and cannot support any person. 
 Workers don't know how much they earn each paycheck. When you are mostly living off of the tips you get in the week you have no idea how much money you will be making. This makes it almost impossible to budget effectively. If you are expecting $300-$500 in a week, you cannot consistently budget. You have to guess how much money you make that week and then hope that you were right. The wage is too inconsistent for most people to be able to live on it. 
 The restaurant industry operates at a very low profit margin. The average profit margin is 3%-5%, according to upserve.com. That means that they already cannot afford to pay the workers much more because they will be losing money. So the only way that they have to make up for that is to increase the amount of money coming in. That means a price hike which could push people away from the business and cause a failure in that business. The industry operates on a low profit margin and that limits what they can do without putting some of the burden on the customer. 
 Overall I would say that abolishing tips would be an idea that deserves a lot of thought. I would definitely agree with the abolition of tips but right after the COVID-19 pandemic I would be against it. The industry has already suffered a lot and does not need to suffer anymore. I would say that restaurants should accept the fact that they will have to pay their workers more and they can come up with ways to do that over the next year or so. That way they have some time to make up for the losses the have seen and they can come up with better ways than we can right now. """"",,,,,,,

Tipping is an important part of jobs for a lot of people, and this is due to the fact that some people make most of their money from tips, it encourages good service, and that removing it from lower end restaurants overall decreases customer satisfaction.
 For a lot of servers, tipping is an essential part of being paid. It has been debated that a lot of restaurants have a significantly low wage for servers, and for a lot of them, tipping is the only way to make sufficient money to make it through the month. Without raising minimum wage, removing tips could enable restaurants to just pocket most of the money from an order, without giving it to the server, causing a lot of people to not be able to pay for groceries, bills, or other expenses.
 Another thing that is debated is whether it increases or decreases customer service, and it is in my opinion that since it makes up most of a server's wage, it is encouraged to maintain a positive attitude towards customers and overall give better service. In this same vein, you can argue that it is more important that tipping stays around because if someone gives bad service, and you are forced to pay for ""decent"" service, you'd be upset that you were forced to pay for something you didn't get. This shows that tipping is also important for deciding whether or not people behave in a professional manner at work, or if they act however they want, because they will be paid the same regardless.
 It is also shown using the Crab Shack experiment that customer satisfaction is generally lower in mid-to-low level establishments, and this is only really untrue for higher end establishments because people willing to pay a lot for food are generally less effected by having to pay a little more for service as well. This, in a way, shows that for most restaurants, it is more accepted from customers to tip good service for waiters, instead of having that money automatically taken from them.
 In general, for purposes of service (on both sides of customer-server interactions), and for sustainable wages, it is imperative that tipping stays around. It is in the best interest of customers, servers, and restaurants to have tipping be the norm. """"",,,,,,,

The answer is restaurants shouldn't stop allowing customers to tip. Tipping has been proven to be more beneficial for the consumers than anyone and it gives employees a chance to earn their worth at their job. Some may argue that having consumers tip also gives them the opportunity to discriminate against consumers and cheat them out of money. But in this case evidence trumps opinion.
 First, restaurants go by a ""the customer is always right"" motto, so the restaurant should want to do things that will make the customers want to come back. Especially since it has been proven that customers like to tip after their meals rather than the all inclusive pricing. Customers see tipping as a way to promote better service from an establishment. If the customer receives good service they give their waitress a nice tip in return. Establishments wanted to see the difference between a all inclusive price and the tipping mechanism. The results were the following excerpt from ""The Crab Shack Experiment"" : ""I found customers rated Joeâ€™s Crab Shack restaurants higher â€“ by about a third of a point on a five-point scale â€“ when they operated under tipping than when they used service-inclusive pricing. Statistical tests indicated that this effect was highly unlikely due to chance."" I strongly believe that these results were recorded because consumers felt that the ""all inclusive pricing"", wasn't worth what they paid for.
 Secondly, it is common knowledge that waitress are extremely underpaid and a lot of time do more than what they get paid for. So by tipping the waitress not only are you filling in the void in their check but you are paying them their worth. Ethically, if you have a good waitress you tip well but if you have a lazy waitress you'd tip them less. This is because you are rewarding the waitress for their good customer service. In Debate Over Tipping it says ""On the other side of the debate, proponents of tipping claim it increases rather than decreases customer service and satisfaction. Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service."" This directly supports the waitresses getting tips in return of their services.
 On the other hand, people do argue that tipping puts customers in the position to be discriminated against by the younger waitresses. Others argue that these individuals aren't as concerned with the customer service that they are providing but more with the tips they receive afterwards. They believe that they younger class of workers disrespect and discriminate against consumers labeled as ""poor tippers"". They believe the disregard for good customer service and want for the tips often result in social pressures. Meaning they feel like the consumers may feel inclined to tipping even when the service was bad. But there is no specific data or experiment that can support this opinion. In fact, the experiments directly rule in opposition to these opinions. In the text Debate over tipping it states ""Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service. ""Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service."" Like I previously mentioned consumers tip based off the service they feel they were given.
 In conclusion, tipping should remain the way it is because it doing just fine. Consumers prefer it and it gives waitresses the opportunity to get paid their worth. Some may say otherwise but there is no data to prove that all inclusive pricing is the best option. So for the hard hitting question, that is "" Should restaurants ban tipping?"". The answer is no, tipping is here to stay.""""",,,,,,,

 the reason not all workers will get the same is because the tips differ. Even if you worked the same number of hours and worked just as hard you might not get the same as someone else. This is unfair to the worker so if tips were abolished then each worker would get the same if they worked the same hours. 
 
 restaurants should pay their workers livable wages so there wonâ€™t be tipping. If the workers were paid a livable wage then they wouldnâ€™t need tips. this also means guests wouldnâ€™t feel pressured to pay tips. However restaurants might have to raise the prices of items on the menu, this could cause a decline in people going to that restaurant. 
 
 tips should be abolished because guest might feel like they have power over workers. In some places people think that the worker has to do whatever the person wants if they want a tip. Sometimes the worker canâ€™t control some of the issues that cause the guest to get mad. Such as the time to get the food, or problems with the food. 
 
 In conclusion i think that restaurants should remove tipping because it doesnâ€™t always affect the worker in a good way. There are alternatives to tipping as well like raising prices of the food.

Not quite literally but with fewer students? Well, I believe that reducing classroom size creates better opportunities for learning in the classroom. One, reducing classroom size creates better communication between the teacher and the students. It also creates better relationships amongst the students. Two, it will free students of any distractions and will allow them to concentrate better. Finally, it makes sure that students can't pretend to know the material and makes sure that students participate in class.
 
 One reason classroom size should be reduced is that the article states that the STAR experiment in Tennessee saw a major impact on learning by reducing classroom size. The text states, ""After four years, students in the small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math."" The text also says ""As the kids grew up, the ones who had been in small classes graduated from high school and attended college at higher rates."" This improved communication between the teacher and students, because the students can seek further instruction from teachers more to make sure they understand the material. Students can also work with classmates, so that they can share what they know. Students are able to learn the material easier, thus working at a faster rate.
 
 Another reason why classroom size should be reduced is that students will be able to concentrate more. Classrooms will have less distractions from other students. This will make the classrooms more quiet for students to focus on assignments. There's also a less chance of students cheating if it were a major problem. This will prevent students from not participating in class and improve scores.
 
 The final reason why classroom size should be reduced is that it makes sure that students participate. In 30 student classes, it's easier for quiet children to blend in with the class and not participate. Reducing classroom size fixes that problem and ensures that all students are able to engage in lessons to understand the material. This makes sure that students canâ€™t pretend to know the material, giving them a chance to voice their ideas.
 
 According to the text, California performed an experiment, the CSR Program. In this experiment, they tested the reduction of classroom size and ending up failing. One reason it failed was that the experiment was a large scale project and was rushed. Another reason the CSR Program failed was all the Tennessee STAR schools had space for smaller classes. But California schools had trouble finding space to fit smaller groups of children into more classes. However, by continuing to experiment with reducing classroom size, we'll be able to progress and eventually come up with a solution for students to learn better in a smaller work environment.
 
 In conclusion, classroom size should be reduced. Students will have more opportunities to seek instruction from teachers if they don't understand the material, which improves the communication between the teacher and students and their relations with classmates. Students will also be able to concentrate more during instruction. Finally, it makes sure that students participate in lessons. In time, we'll be able to come up with a solution that will improve learning for students, but until then, all we can do is continue experimenting.""""",,,,,,,

Fancy ones, old fashioned ones, or just your everyday fast food joints. You may have worked at one before. If you have, you shouldn't be new to tips. If you've ever worked at a restaurant before, you know that tips can help a lot. Michael Lynn's article, ""How the war on tipping harms customers"" enlightens us on the controversial topic of tipping. This leads me believe that restaurants should NOT ban tipping. Restaurants should not ban tipping because the alternatives of tipping receive negative reviews and ratings from people.
 The Crab Shack experiment was a clear example of why tipping should not be banned. According to the article, ""One study focused on the restaurant chain Joeâ€™s Crab Shack. This chain replaced tipping with higher service-inclusive menu prices at 18 of its restaurants, only to reverse course six months later and bring tipping back at 14 of the locations."" Evidence from the author shows that customers rated Joe's Crab Shack restaurants higher by a third of a point on a five-point scale when they operated under tipping than when they used service-inclusive pricing. This shows that customers would rather tip than be automatically charged. People usually want to be able to choose whether they want to tip or not, rather than be automatically charged.
 Further evidence includes online reviews. The author was able to track reviews on Joe's Crab Shack using ReviewTrackers. When Joe's Crab Shack decided to move to service-inclusive pricing, the author was able to track its reviews from customers. The author found that after switching to service-inclusive pricing, reviews were more likely to mention tipping, the server or service and price. These reviews usually had lower ratings. This also shows that customers would rather tip than be automatically charged.
 However, there's always a different side of a coin. Some might argue that tipping should be banned. According to the author's article, ""Opponents of tipping argue it pays workers low and unreliable incomes, discriminates against less attractive servers as well as servers of color and empowers customers to sexually harass female servers."" Some might also argue that tipping leads to bad customer service. Some may think this because it supposedly attracts the less professional young, to tipped occupations. It also puts unwanted social pressures on people to tip money that they might actually need.
 Moreover, tipping should still not be banned. Tipping should not be banned because instead of attracting less professional people to tipped occupations, it might rather attract competent workers that will work harder to keep their customers satisfied. In simpler terms, tips equal good service and good service equals satisfied customers. Tips are supposed to be a reward for good service, so if workers make sure their customers are satisfied, then tips should not be a problem and thus, should not be banned. So if you worked at a restaurant like Joe's Crab Shack, would you want tips to be banned? Probably not, since those tips go in YOUR pocket.""""",,,,,,,

15720267,5/27/21,6,Butler Traditional High,Kimberly Walker,U6DWKQ,Kaitlyn Schutte,NULL,"""Restaurants should not ban tipping. When wealthy Americans brought home the practice of tipping from their
 European vacations in the late 19th century, their countrymen considered it bribery.
 State legislature quickly banned the practice. But restaurateurs, giddy at the prospect of
 passing labor costs directly to customers, eventually persuaded Americans to accept
 tipping.
 We had it right the first time. Tipping is a repugnant custom. It's bad for
 consumers and terrible for workers. It perpetuates racism. Tipping isn't even good for
 restaurants, because the legal morass surrounding gratuities results in scores of
 expensive lawsuits.
 Tipping does not incentivize hard work. The factors that correlate most strongly to
 tip size have virtually nothing to do with the quality of service. Credit card tips are larger
 than cash tips. Large parties with sizable bills leave disproportionately small tips. We tip
 servers more if they tell us their names, touch us on the arm, or draw smiley faces on
 our checks. Quality of service has a laughably small impact on tip size. According to a
 2000 study, a customerâ€™s assessment of the server's work only accounts for between 1
 and 5 percent of the variation in tips at a restaurant.
  Tipping also creates a racially charged feedback loop, based around the widely
 held assumption â€”explored in an episode of Louie, in the Oscar-winning film Crash,
 and elsewhereâ€”that African-Americans tend to be subpar tippers. There seems to be
 some truth to this stereotype: African-Americans, on average, tip percentage points less
 than white customers. The tipping gap between Hispanics and whites is smaller, but still
 discernible in studies. This creates an excuse for restaurant servers to prioritize the
 needs of certain ethnic groups over others.
 Irrelevant or insidious factors will dominate the tipping equation until quality of
 work becomes the main driver of tip size, but that's unlikely to happen. And tip size isn't
 the real problem anyway. The real problem is that restaurants don't pay their employees
 a living wage. The federal â€œtip credit"" allows restaurants to pay their tipped employees
 as little as $2.13 per hour, as long as tips make up the shortfallâ€”which turns a customer
 into a co-employer. Although federal and state law requires restaurants to ensure that
 tips bring employees up to minimum wage, few diners know that. (Hosts/hostesses,
 bussers, and food runners, who receive a small fraction of the serversâ€™ tips, often fall
 short of minimum wage on some nights.) The tip credit has turned the gratuity into a
 moral obligation, and we ought to cut it from our statute books with a steak knife.
 The only real beneficiary of the preposterously complicated tip credit is lawyers. 6
  Imagine what it's like for a company running restaurants in multiple states. There's no
 tip credit in some states, like California and Washington, where tipped employees must
 be paid the full minimum wage. Hawaii allows the tip credit only if the combined tip and
 cash wage surpass the statewide minimum hourly wage by 50 cents. New York and
 Connecticut have different minimum wages for servers, hotel employees, and
 bartenders.
 Then you have to consider time that employees spend on activities not likely to yield
 tips. Applebee's, for example, has suffered a series of legal setbacks in lawsuits
 brought by tipped employees seeking back pay for time spent cleaning toilets and
 washing glassware.
 The laws regarding tip sharing and tip pooling, which occur in virtually every
 restaurant, are even more complicated. Federal law allows mandatory tip sharing, but
 only among employees who customarily receive either direct or indirect tips. That
 means servers, bussers, food runners, and hosts and hostesses can be required to pool
 their tips with each other, but not with managers. Unfortunately, the line between service
 and management is fuzzy in many restaurants, and differences between state laws
 further complicate matters. A California judge ordered Starbucks to pay $105 million in
 2008 for forcing 100,000 baristas to share tips with supervisors. Last week, the New
 York Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion, ruling that New York law allows
 the arrangement. Chiliâ€™s has also lost a multimillion dollar judgment over tip sharing.
 The entire mess is begging for some certainty and predictability. Restaurants
 need a clear set of rules to follow. Servers should have a steadier income stream. Hosts
 and bussers, who have relatively little interaction with customers, ought not to be
 involved in tipping at all. Customers need more clarity as well, instead of worrying at the
 end of a meal if the waiter, or your guests, approve of your 17 percent tip.
 I'd like to propose a solution. First, ask your state and federal representatives to
 abolish the tip credit, which would turn tips back into actual gratuities: something given
 free of obligation. Second, announce your tipping practice to your server as soon as you
 sit down. Virtually every other employee in America knows how much they'll be paid up
 front, and somehow the man who sells me shoes and the woman who does my dry
 cleaning still manage to provide adequate service. I have no doubt waiters and
 waitresses are the same. Finally, tip a flat, but reasonably generous, dollar amount per
 person in your party. Around 20 percent of Americans, mostly older people, tip a flat
 amount already, so it's not exactly revolutionary. A server's pay shouldn't be linked to
 whether or not you have room for dessert.""""",,,,,,,

If a tip was included in every bill, then wages would be more livable for servers. When higher service-inclusive menu prices occurred at Joe's Crab Shack, many people were upset and reviews on the restaurant began to go down, stated in paragraph 11. """"",,,,,,,

Where could schools possibly find so many new teachers so fast? Some schools recruited teachers from other states, trained other staff to teach, or moved teachers from different grades."" this was one of the down sides to try to adpt to less kids in classrooms. 
  
 In the article it also gave good examples of classroom size being reduced. The main reason was project star. the article said "" STAR (for Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio). A randomized controlled experiment assigns participants to either a treatment or a control group based on chance, like by a coin flip. The treatment group receives something (such as a medicine or program) that the control group doesn't. Then researchers compare the two groups. This process is a big deal because it measures if a treatment really works. The results of this experiment were clear: being in a small class had a large impact on learning. After four years, students in the small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math. They continued to do better even after returning to regular-sized classes. ""
 
 So yes classroom size should be reduced. but not instantly and people should take it into consideration that just because it worked in one place doesn't it gonna work in another. If schools wanna do the experiment they should also know that it not gonna work instantly. they have to wait few years to see the true outcome.

People who do not like to tip a lot are also satisfied because it says it allows restaurants to charge low prices. I mean I'm sure everyone loves a low price meal. Workers that go above and beyond for their customers especially at a high paced work should be rewarded for their service. If my meal is cheap, I don't see the problem in throwing in a tip for the worker who brought ans served me my meal. All inclusive pricing is extra. On the other hand, people may think that tipping isn't fair because it leaves it up to the customer to decide who and who not to tip, and how much they get. Most people are against tipping because it puts pressure on people who would rather keep their money. Tipping isn't a mandatory thing, but it is a complete nice gesture.

 One reason why i feel as though restaurants should ban tipping is because it discriminates against less attractive servers. i say this because due to the server being someone less attractive makes people discriminate against them because they arent good looking, just like how people could discriminate with color or religion. since the server only makes so much without the power of tips, it makes it even worse if the costumer does not tip. servers depend on tips. its degrading to know that you are not making as much just because someone thinks your less attractive than another waiter, whos making 2x more in tips than what another server is. 
 
 another reason why i think tipping should be banned is because it gives customers the power to sexually harass female workers. i say this because if a female server comes up to a table with a group of men and shes attractive, its common that they will harass her or bother her the whole time the woman is serving them. it makes it worse that most female servers are younger, making it easier for them to become a target to men who come in to get served by them. customers already know that the workers want to get paid more so sometimes they can almost do what they want because they know the server wants to get tipped and that getting tipped is almost like a privilege. 
 
 my final reason why i feel like tipping should be banned is because it puts unwanted pressures on people to part with money they rather keep. i say this because since tipping isnt included in the check , its almost rude to not tip a waiter. for example, if you were to go to a restaurant with a group of people or maybe one other person, its rude to not leave any type of tip to the waiter who tried their best to make sure your experience was good. even though you are not being forced to tip, it still feels rude not to do so. i think adding the tip automatically to the bill, people will be more willing to pay it. 
 
 i do agree that tipping can increase customer service and satisfaction but if tips are already included in the bill, the server or waiter will still do their best to make sure the customer is satisfied throughout the whole experience. 
 
 to conclude, i think tipping should be banned. i say this because it discriminates against less attractive servers, gives customers the power to sexually harass female servers, and it puts unwanted social pressures on people to part with money they would rather keep. tipping doesnt do anything but force servers to kiss up to people who can be rude.""""",,,,,,,

 So if you have the people and funds then the classroom size should indeed be shrunk. Even from personal expirence ive always felt more confortable in smaller classes, and im more likely to share and talk about things in them. I think smaller classes can be benificial for so much more than just education, but student comfort to.

Although there are arguments like the discrimination of less attractive employees or employees of color, i find most of the negatives to tipping to be an issue outside the restaurant's control, but instead a problem with the individual eating at said restaurant. Tipping has become a norm in this country, and has become where the majority of waiters' and waitress' pay comes from. It is stated in the passage that ""Restaurants that replaced tipping with automatic service charges experienced about a quarter of a point drop in online ratings, while those that switched to service-inclusive pricing saw a decline of only about a 10th of a point."" This shows that tipping not only is a positive for the people working at the establishment, but the ones eating there. It gives people a choice while tacking the tip onto the bill makes them feel forced, as the passage said ""The studyâ€™s data do not tell me why service charges decreased ratings more than did inclusive-pricing, but I suspect that it was because consumers hate being forced to tip more. Higher prices, on their own, are less objectionable."" and i suspect the same. Tipping is too common place already and there has not yet been a way to replace it that results in a net positive according to the passage's findings. A key thing to note is that less pricey restaurants suffered more of a hit when replacing tipping than more expensive ones, likely because diners at more expensive restaurants may be more expecting to a higher price, or as the passage says, ""Their wealthier customers, who are less sensitive to the added costs of service charges or inclusive-pricing, are less likely to punish them.""""""",,,,,,,

Tipping is a way fro the employees to be able to earn extra money on top of their hourly wages. Now, it is becoming a controversial topic in the world. Personally I believe that tipping your waiter or waitress is something that all people should do. A major reason is because it can persuade the employees to work hard so they can earn their tips. 
 
   Evidence that supports my reasoning comes from paragraph 4 under the Debate Over Tipping portion of the text. The text states ""On the other side of the debate, proponents of tipping claim it increases rather than decreases customer service and satisfaction."". People have been talking about how tipping the waiters or waitresses rewards them for their hard work. This is supported in the same paragraph which also states ""Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service."". This supports my thinking because it proves that other people have thought the same thing and that it actually benefits them in the long run when they tip. 
 
 Some might say that tipping is not a good option to go for because it allows the wait staff to slack off becasue they think they will automatically get a tip no matter what. My rebuttal to this is that no all people are going to slack off becasue they need their job to get by in life. Just becasue they work in the restaraunt field doesn't mean that everyone who works in that field is going to slack off.""""",,,,,,,

Restaurant tipping only hurts the workers as well as the customers. According to the article ""How the war on tipping harms customers"", the author, Michael Lynn, goes into depth to explain how restaurant tipping doesn't benefit the people its intended to support; the workers. He claims ""tipping detracts from customers' dining experience."" This means that the customer could have had pretty bad service, yet they would still be expected to tip. Tips are typically meant to be a thank you for the waiter/waitress and the service they provided for the customer. If their dining experience is being detracted, why tip? Lynn then goes on to say ""Opponents of tipping argue it pays workers low and unreliable incomes and discriminates against less attractive servers"". By saying this, he gives an example on how much these workers rely on tipping. The big part of how much restaurant workers make is based off of how much they make in tips. Not to mention, this makes for a very inconsistent income. Some servers may not make as much in tips due to things outside of their control; things such as a slow day, or a menu item shortage. Due to the fact that customers tip, restaurants are able to make their menu prices lower. Although this may be beneficial for the customers, servers aren't really getting anything out if it unless the customer decides to tip, but then again servers wouldn't have to rely on tips as much if they were payed a higher hourly salary. Fast food workers earn more than restaurant servers while more than often, servers work more intensely with customers, yet they earn less. All in all, tipping should be taken out of restaurants.

Some have debated that tipping alternatives such as inclusive pricing could benefit customer satisfaction as well as the restaurant workers. I'd argue the opposite, as restaurant review data suggests otherwise. Inclusive tipping actually makes the customer's experience worse, as they have to pay a set fee for their service whether is was good or bad.
 Data shows that midrange to low end restaurants review suffers from inclusive pricing, as the people dining there are more concerned about money then people dining at classier restaurants, so paying more for their food, instead of paying for what they think their service deserves actually leads them into giving a worse review. ReviewTrackers (An online firm that reviews company ratings) and Michael Lynn proves this. His article (The Conversation) says ""I found customers rated Joeâ€™s Crab Shack restaurants higher â€“ by about a third of a point on a five-point scale â€“ when they operated under tipping than when they used service-inclusive pricing"" This shows that customers actually enjoy their experience more when they decide how much the tip is, and when inclusive tipping isn't involved.

Lynn said, ""Restaurants that replaced tipping with automatic service charges experienced about a quarter of a point drop in online ratings... wealthier customers, who are less sensitive to the added costs of service charges or inclusive-pricing, are less likely to punish them."" This shows that other forms of tipping other than the traditional way leads to a decline in ratings, and customer satisfaction. You could argue that new ways of tipping like inclusive-pricing could benefit the server more than traditional tipping because they are basically obligated to a tip because it is forced upon the customer, but this could lead to workers not putting in their best effort, or doing a worse of a job as they no longer have an incentive.

 Reason&claim-I believe restaurants should ban tipping because it gives companies a reason to lower wages to there staff exploting of their basic wages. 
 
 In the article, ""How the war on tipping harms customers,"" by Michael Lynn, he says,â€Opponents of tipping argue it pays workers low and unreliable incomes""(Lynn, 2017). 
 Reason-It supports my reason and claim because my evidence is talking about the low and unreliable incomes and wages.
 Counterargument: I believe Resturant shouldnâ€™t ban tipping because Because if you get rid of tips and start paying a fair wage, the only way to pay for it is by raising prices or adding an automatic service charge to every check and also thatâ€™s how most waitresses make there money is by tips. But from my point of view Resturant should be ban because To discourage tipping may cause confusion for guests and it removes the emotional connection that servers and diners have become to as restaurant-going experience.

In paragraph four, it states that the result had a huge impact. After four years, the students that were in small classes were now seven mouths ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math. They continuously did better than the kids in the regular classroom size. These students grew to graduate high school and attended colleges at higher rates. 
 One bad result from reducing classroom sizes is that it could be very unorganized and just too much. Under the section "" Reality Check"", California had to hire about 18,000 more teachers because they were in a shortage after reducing the classrooms. This meaning many of the teachers had to switch grade levels, and many were not even ready because some haven't finished their requirements to be a teacher and some had no experience.

15713694,5/24/21,6,Butler Traditional High,Rebecca Zaboronak,PJU3JW,Akiyah Huff,NULL,"""Banning tipping in restaurants has been a back and forth debating topic over the U.S. Some restaurants took action and actually replaced tipping with automatic service charges. After reading the article, I do not think restaurants should ban tipping. The reason why I think tipping shouldn't be banned is because customers are happier with tipping their own amount of money, rather than the restaurant automatically charging them. In â€œHow the war on tipping harms customersâ€ and under the heading, Debate over tipping, it says â€œFor these reasons, most consumers in the United States say that they prefer tipping over automatic service charges or inclusive pricingâ€. Many people don't feel like their waiter deserves the tip that some restaurants automatically charge because not every waiter is a good waiter. Another reason not to take away tipping is because some waiters actually do work really hard and work good for those tips. Under the same heading, it says that tips are supposed to be a reward for the service they put out and taking tipping away is taking away a lot of money they earned. With tips being a waiters/waitresses main source of income, you're hurting their money and could cause many other problems. This proves why we should not ban tipping and allow these waiters/waitresses to take home the money they worked hard for. However, on the other hand, banning tipping would give waiters a chance to find a job with an actual realistic amount of hourly pay. Under Debate over tipping, it says â€œOpponents of tipping argue it pays workers low and unreliable incomes, discriminates against less attractive servers as well as servers of color and empowers customers to sexually harass female serversâ€. Being a server, the majority of your income comes from tips. This means they usually make around 2-3 dollars per hour in wages, which is unrealistic. But if they only make so little in hour wages, why would we want to take that away. Tipping is an important factor in becoming a server anywhere. It brings lots of benefits like bettering social skills, making nice money even bringing back the same or even more customers. With keeping tipping around, it allows restaurants to make their menu cheaper, reducing the amount of eating out would cost.""""",,,,,,,

I think that classroom sizes should be reduced. By doing this, it will help improve the learning of students. Classroom reduction will help students get better grades, help them focus better, and make it so that teachers can get closer to the students, and have more time to help them on work. 
 
 Reducing class sizes will help students improve their grades, including test scores. An experiment called STAR was conducted in Tennessee to see if test grades would improve if there were less students in the classes. In the text, it says, ""After four years, students in small classes were seven months ahead in reading and almost four months ahead in math."" This proves that smaller classes sizes helps students improve their grades and learning skills. They were able to improve greatly in four years time, being six months ahead of what they should've been. This is huge improvement, proving my claim of reducing classroom sizes helps in learning.
 
 This will also help them focus better. When I'm in class, there are usually about 28 kids in there, and there just so much noise. I couldn't focus properly, or fully listen to what the teacher was saying. But at times, when alot of students were absent or missing, and there was barely anyone in the class, I found myself being able to focus more well. With the smaller number of students, I could focus on the teacher better. The noises were gone, and the teacher could also keep their focus on teaching us. With my first hand experience, this helps support my claim. By focusing well, you can improve your grades and learn better.
 
 Smaller classroom sizes help teachers get closer to the students, and have more time to teach. If there are less students there, teachers can get closer and help them more effiecently, since they will not feel rushed. Less students means more time. I found that when we had less students in our class, the teachers were focused on learning more and got closer to us in that short amount of time. This proves that when there are a smaller number of students in a class, the teachers can help the students more, and get closer to us in just a short amount of time and not feel rushed.
 
 Now, you may argue that this is not efficent for all schools, and this may not work, but it is possible for everyone. You just can't give up. Everything takes time, and you need the proper factors, and things to successfully reduce the size of your classroom. Jumping into things very quickly is not ideal, and your outcome will most likely be unsatisfactory. This process may take a while, but it's very worth it. In the text, it says, ""Astronomer Allan Sandage once described science as a process that progresses only by showing itself to be wrong. When things don't work as scientists expect, they ask new questions, find new answers, and end up knowing even more."" Just because something doesn't work out the first time doesn't mean you should give up. Your hard work will pay off in the end. Reducing classroom sizes will help improve the learning of students.""""",,,,,,,
15713703,5/24/21,6,Butler Traditional High,Rebecca Zaboronak,PJU3JW,Carleigh Newman,NULL,"""Do you think restaurants should ban tipping? I don't think restaurants should ban tipping. Now, there are many reasons why banning tips would not be beneficial. You have to take into account both the customers and the restaurant workers. Tips help motivate workers to give better customer service. Customers prefer tipping over no-tipping policies. Restaurants with no tipping policies menu's look more pricier, and that causes customers to look away. These are some reasons why tips should not be banned.
 
 First of all, tips help motivate workers to give better customer service. Because they want higher tips, they will work very hard and do their best to please their customers. This will also make customers happy because they are getting better service. So both and restaurant workers, and the customer are satisficed. That's ideal in business. Also, if restaurants do not let customers offer tips, possible workers will look away from that particular place because they are not getting any tips. This will cause businesses to have a shortage on employees. In the passage, it says, ""Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service."" 
 
 Another reason why restaurants should not ban tipping is because it has been shown that customers prefer tipping over non-tipping services. An experiment that can support this is called The Crab Shack experiment that the author of this passage conducted. This restaurant chain replaced tipping with higher service-inclusive menu prices, and customers were not happy. The studies showed that customers reviews, and services decreased after there was a tipping ban. In the passage, it says, ""I found customers rated Joeâ€™s Crab Shack restaurants higher â€“ by about a third of a point on a five-point scale â€“ when they operated under tipping than when they used service-inclusive pricing. Statistical tests indicated that this effect was highly unlikely due to chance."" This shows that customers favored the tipping rather than the higher service-inclusive menu prices. 
 
 Lastly, restaurants with no-tipping polices menu's had higher prices, and this causes customers to look away. Since restaurants banned tipping, the choices on their menus were more pricier, and because of this customers do not eat there. They don't want to pay higher prices when dining. They would much rather just give their own tips and choose the amount of the tip so they do not have to worry about a certain price. Because customers do not want to dine at places with no-tipping policies and higher menu prices, restaurant revenue does down because no one is eating there. In the passage, it says, ""Another thing in tippingâ€™s favor is that it allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices, which stingier tippers like because it reduces the costs of eating out. For these reasons, most consumers in the United States say that they prefer tipping over automatic service charges or inclusive pricing.""
 
 On the other hand, people may argue that banning tips are beneficial. They might say that tipping attracts poorer customer service and satisfaction, but this is not true. Tipping gives both workers and customers and sense of pride, and makes them happy. Tips motivate workers to do better in their jobs, so customer service is naturally better because they want more money.
 
 To summarize, restaurants banning tipping services is not beneficial at all. Restaurants should allow tipping. It makes both the customers and the workers more happy and satisfied. It causes the workers to give better service, and do better at their job. It also allows prices on menu's to be lower, and research shows that customers favor lower prices on their meals. In the passage, it says, ""The studyâ€™s data do not tell me why service charges decreased ratings more than did inclusive-pricing, but I suspect that it was because consumers hate being forced to tip more. Higher prices, on their own, are less objectionable."" These are just a few of the reasons why I think that resturants should not ban tipping. """"",,,,,,,

I just feel like it takes some stress off the kids when they have questions and don't want to talk in front of class. Students can learn more with fewer kids in classes because it won't take long for teachers long to get with them but when there's more kids it's gone take longer. "" Then an experiment in Tennessee in the 1980s plainly showed that students had learned more in classes with fewer students. Bingo!"". Another reason I think classes should be smaller because it gives those students more opportunities to and higher chances of succeeding in life. Test scores is another big problem because If there wasn't a lot of people in classes they would have more time in class to do their test, but instead they have to rush because they only have a short amount of time to get it done and they rush.

15712747,5/24/21,6,Butler Traditional High,Rebecca Zaboronak,BGAZ5G,Darryl Douglas,NULL,"""I feel like tipping should not be ban because itâ€™s just a appreciation from the customer to the worker. I say that because workers could be having a bad day or struggling with money and thatâ€™s going to help them. One reason I say no Is people give tips in general if the food and customer service is on point. People like when their food is right and the workers are really cool and nice to them. Another reason is people could be struggling with bills at home so they work and the tips help them more so they wonâ€™t have to keep struggling. You will never know what someone is going through until you walk in their shoes. The last reason is some people just need a side job for extra spending money. People just want a little more money to spend.
  I feel like they shouldnâ€™t ban tips because thatâ€™s a customers saying thank you to the workers for their hard work. People know in general itâ€™s harder working at restaurants like that because you have rude and disrespectful people. â€œTips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalizedâ€. When I go out to eat we always leave a tip because restaurant workers be going through a lot and have to deal with a lot especially the public. Tipping should be allowed because If you donâ€™t leave one thatâ€™s gone make the workers feel like they did a bad job. Tips are preferred because severs make less than minimum wage and wonâ€™t make any money if no one tips.
  Another reason is people are trying to work because they struggling with bills at home and need fast money. Most servers like to get paid daily so they take advantage of tips. â€œAnother interesting finding from the second study was that the negative impact of getting rid of tipping was related to how pricey or cheap the restaurant wasâ€. People need money for bills and they might be late but if the tips arenâ€™t banned they can use the tips to help out. I feel like tips is the main part of a restaurant if the food is good. If the workers gets a tip they know they doing something right and they gone keep doing that to get tips.
  The last reason I feel like donâ€™t need to ban tips is because people only use that for side money. â€œ Restaurants that replaced tipping with automatic service charges experienced about a quarter of a point drop in online ratings, while those that switched to service-inclusive pricing saw a decline of only about a 10th of a point.â€ People use that extra income for their kids or just to spoil themselves . I feel like if they ban tips itâ€™s just a selfish thing and people donâ€™t want to see other people get money. At the end banning tips is not good in my opinion because yâ€™all taking money from other people who might be really looking forward to that money.
  I feel like they should ban tips because why do they need tips if they getting paid already. â€œ I also found that after switching to service-inclusive pricing, reviewersâ€™ comments were more likely to mention tipping, the server or service and priceâ€. If they getting tips thereâ€™s no reason they should get a paycheck because they get paid daily. I just feel like if tips get ban the prices would increase because no tips equals more food and prices. Banning tips is a good idea because people donâ€™t really need tips they just taking peoples money at this point.
  To wrap everything up I feel like tips should not be ban. Tips is just giving the workers a little appreciation for their hard work and dignity for what they have to deal with. Tips arenâ€™t even mandatory, there a thought of the customer. Tips are a thought the workers donâ€™t ask for them the customers just leaves them on the table. Donâ€™t get mad when customers leave tips thatâ€™s just telling people they has a good sever and the food was just how they asked.""""",,,,,,,

 It's known that tipping workers is an optional choice and not a force to do, people choose whether they should tip workers on how good their service is to them. Tipping workers has never went wrong before and that's because no worker has never complain about someone being generous to them. Proponents has actually claimed that it increases customer satisfaction. Tipping the workers not only help the worker but helps restaurants too, some had lower prices on their menu because of all the tips their workers has been getting.
 The only bad thing I could see coming from tipping workers could be the pressure the customer had put on the worker. I had an experience when I was offered a tip from a customer and I took it but I really did not like how all the eyes on me when I received the tip. I don't like having a lot of social attention towards me in public so other workers like me wouldn't either but at the same time others wouldn't mind the social pressure from the tip.

Tipping was always a controversial subject but researches from the article have found that customers satisfaction was higher when normal tipping was in place. I feel that tipping should be the traditional way and shouldnâ€™t change. Some people think that you shouldnâ€™t use regular tipping because it hurts the workers. Some restaurants have even replaced tipping with automatic service charges and charges it to their bill. Which means that the tipping charge would be already be added to their bill and they would have to pay it. However, some people donâ€™t really like this Idea which is understandable. Tipping and other service fee should not be charged to your bill. I think tipping should be left exactly how it is now. I do think it is unfair when people do not tip even when they have very good service but adding the charges will mature things worse. People who are tipped, get based off how good they treated their customers. Therefore, I think it benefits not only the customer, but the server. This makes the server want to work for a better and higher tip. Customers who are dinning in are likely to have a better experience at restaurants when servers are motivated by the tips as well. In the article it stated, â€œResearch finding suggest that people would rather pay a tip at restaurants then be charge exclusive and other fees.â€ The article also stated that people who enjoy dining in will eventually stop if they are charged more than what they used to pay. When Joeâ€™s crab shack did a study, and change their tipping policies, customers rated them lower once they put the services and tip together. Joeâ€™s was rated higher (which was a three out of five points) when they operated under the normal tipping policyâ€™s. Once they switch to including their prices, customer reviews on their website were more likely to mention tipping, and how much the price is increased but of this new change. The article stated that â€œthe no tipping policy decrease customers overall satisfaction with their dining experience.â€ These reviews are really just the reasons why we shouldnâ€™t take away tipping. Not only does it make the customers happy it helps the workers as well. However, I know that the article also stated that people get treated different because of their color. And this means that they wonâ€™t get a higher tip or they get treated differently. Another big problem would be sexual-harassment. Many workers should not have to put up with this and it isnâ€™t fair but, that one bad table should not affect the rest of their day or the amount of money they bring in. Thereâ€™s always going to be people in the world who donâ€™t like certain things but things are changing and studies have shown that customers are more happy with prices not being added onto their bills. Therefore, if all these restaurants weâ€™re going to add on all the charges to the bill many people would stop dining in which would stop bringing not only the restaurants but their workers money. And many people argue that workers already didnâ€™t make enough money so why try to make it worse for them. Sipping makes dining services better and at the end of the day helps the workers and the customers.

""Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service"". If restaurateurs ban tipping, they will most likely see a decline in customer service. As a result of poor or Â¨lazyÂ¨customer service, the number of customers would decline.
 
 Another reason why restaurateurs shouldnâ€™t ban tipping is because it allows people to buy affordable food. In the passage, the author states, ""Another thing in tippingâ€™s favor is that it allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices, which stingier tippers like because it reduces the costs of eating out "". With cheaper food prices and good customer service for the workers, the customer can leave satisfied and happy while the worker can enjoy a nice tip. Remove tipping from restaurants and the customer will leave unsatisfied due t poor customer service from the workers.
 
 Opponents of tipping claims tipping doesn't mean good customer service. ""Some also believe that it leads to poorer rather than better customer service and satisfaction "".

 ""They continued to do better even after returning to regular-sized classes."" Reduced classroom sizes have a long-term effect on students learning. Even though the students moved back into regular-sized classrooms, they were still benefiting from the reduced classes.
 
 But the STAR program transitioned smoothly and had the correct resources needed, unlike the California CSR program which turned out bad.

If restaurants ban tipping it will help the workers make a consistent amount of money. It will also make the customers happy. In this writing I will show why tipping should be banned in restaurants.
 
 One reason why tipping should be banned is for the workers' sake. Tipping has some very negative effects for workers. One of these effects is inconsistent income. In the article ""How the war on tipping harms customers'' it said'' Opponents of tipping argue it pays workers low and unreliable incomes."" This shows why tipping should be banned because if workers are getting low and unreliable incomes, they can't pay for stuff they need to live. Another affect is how tipping can lead discrimination to who can work at a restaurant. In the same article it said "" discriminates against less attractive servers as well as servers of color."" This shows how tipping can lead to some people not getting a job and making a living for themselves just because of their color or that they are less attractive. 
 
 Another reason why tipping should be banned is for the customers sake. Tipping can lead many customers to have a bad experience at a restaurant. In the article ""How the war on tipping harms customers'' it said ""younger, part-time and less professional workers to tipped occupations, undermines serversâ€™ intrinsic motivations to care for their customers."" This show why tipping should be banned because if you're going to a restaurant you do not want to have a server who doesn't care about your needs. Another thing tipping causes is social pressure. In the same article it said ""A final argument against tipping is that it puts unwanted social pressures on people to part with money they would rather keep."" This shows why tipping should be banned because people shouldn't have to be pressured into tipping someone especially if they don't have much money on them.
 
 Now some might say that tipping shouldn't be because it is a reward for servers which can lead to better service, however tipping can hurt the worker because they are not making a lot of money. If a server is doing their absolute best to make sure you have the best experience, you should tip them a good amount ,but the bad thing about tipping is that you don't have to tip them a big amount. You could tip them little to nothing for their service. So this server did all this hard work just to get very little.
 
 In conclusion tipping should be banned. If tipping is banned it can lead to better service for the customer. It can also help many workers who are getting low and inconsistent incomes. It also gets rid of the discrimination of who gets to work at a restaurant. These are the reasons why tipping should be banned at restaurants.

If tipping would be banned the prices of menus would rise, this simple thing would make people who don't have money to blow not want to eat out and in turn that would make that establishment lose money. Also tipping is a way of making waiters and waitress give better services Because they know they would get paid for their work.
 
 Tipping is more to and a establishments success than people really thing. If there was not tipping prices would rise due to the built in service fees and things of that sort. That thing would make people not want to eat out at all. Its stated that ""Another thing in tippingâ€™s favor is that it allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices, which stingier tippers like because it reduces the costs of eating out"". This right here proves that with tipping more people are likely to come and eat there because of the low prices. It would reel in many people because that's being shown and so that would make that buisness more successful.
 
 Another reason why tipping shouldnt be banned is because the waiters/waitress would give better services knowing that if they do a good job they would get a better chance of being tipped more. This makes people want to be their best so they can get the best. Its sayed that "" Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service.""
 
 But on the other hand tipping can be a bit shaky due to people not being fair to everyone. What i mean by this is that many people will be discriminated and sexually against for the race,gender, and looks. "" discriminates against less attractive servers as well as servers of color and empowers customers to sexually harass female servers."" This is reason why banning tips is not so bad of a idea because people get mistreated constantly . ANd for a person to get mistreated and service people and not get paid is a injustice. 
 
 But in conclusion i feel as if banning tips would be bad. I dont fully agree with not banning them but many people and companies see the great side effects of tipping. And of course there is some negatives to but those negatives can be solved> Thank your for reading my opinoin.

But that's not the point , when you go to dine in restaurants your expected to leave a tip for your waiter to show your appreciation. But I believe restaurants should in fact ban tipping.
 
  Yes , I said it restaurants should ban tipping but I have plenty of reasons why for one it brings competition , it makes poor customer service and it makes for a poor work environment. Yeah of course tipping is nice and everything but I feel like it becomes kind of like a competition . Waiters act like there in competition with other waiters and it often brings conflict . I know this from experience because I worked at a diner and all of the other waiters felt as if you were trying to steal there job or become better then them so it turns into competition. I feel like waiters and waitresses should all get paid the same amount and tips should be banned. Another reason I think tips should be banned is because some people can't afford to give extra money out , yes in some cases tips are optional but it's like if you don't leave a tip you feel guilty. Others may argue that tips should not be banned because if so , menu prices could possibly go up. Others may also argue that tips are a sign of appreciation and if there banned it will create tension between the customer and server. I agree that menu prices would go up but I would rather pay a little extra for a good meal then to be almost forced to leave a tip. Also , even though tips show appreciation I believe verbally praising someone is just enough to show thanks to your server. 
 
  In conclusion everyone has there on view on tipping , and who knows if tipping will ever actually get banned. But i think it would be a good idea if it does fall through. For the sake of communties and customer service , it will be a good change.

  Tipping helps by improving customer service by if you tip a waitress it could make their day. They might be having a bad day and by you tipping them may make it better. Tipping helps them want to work better and satisfy the customers more.For example in the article it says that tipping means good service and satisfaction. If the customers are happy that is a good thing for the restaurant. If they took away tipping I dont think that people would make it off of minimum wage. Waitresses already dont make enough and by doing this it would just cause them to struggle more than some already are. If they take away tipping they would lose their employees. Why would they want to work there if they are barely making any money. If they take away tipping that means they would have to decrease the prices which means less money, less employees, and more customers complaining. Many people would agree with me but some may disagree on that they should ban tipping. A couple of reasons that they should ban tipping is some waitresses get treated bad and disrespected, some get discriminated. I think that this would be the main reason why they would ban tipping because on how they are treated but there are still many ways to avoid those problems. 
 
  After reading this article restaurants not banning tipping is the right way to go. Many people will argue and say they are not but i think they should.

Did that make you feel upset? Today Iâ€™m going to be telling you why restaurants should not automatic service charge/ inclusive pricing. 
 
 According to the text, it states â€œ A final argument against tipping is that it puts unwanted social pressures on people to part with money they would rather keep.â€ Nowadays people already have a budget they plan on spending when going out due to bills and etc. So far tips to be added to the cost harm costumers because the recipes already puts an certain amount of tipping rather than what the costumers was willing to give/ what the costumers have in their pocket.
 
 In addition the text states â€œ Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service.â€. I totally agree with this, tips should be a reward for how great the workers service were. How great you manage to get everyoneâ€™s food ready and out on time and how respectful you are to the customers should be decided on them on how much to tip you. 
 
 Furthermore, coming from the text â€œSome also believe that it leads to poorer rather than better customer service and satisfaction.â€ With this being said if a waiter know he/ she is getting tipped regardless than they do not care how they address costumers. This is not ok no matter if your still getting paid or not you should address costumers with respect. It can cost you in the end to lose a job and etc. you should address everyone with nice greetings through the whole day. You never know whatâ€™s going to happen so be polite. 
 
 However, some people believe that â€œOpponents of tipping argue it pays workers low and unreliable incomes, discriminates against less attractive servers as well as servers of color and empowers customers to sexually harass female servers.â€ In fact this is not true. If your doing your job and being a real real good waiter and taking your time with the consumers, they would look beyond any of that. Itâ€™s all about how your approaching the costumers. 
 
 In conclusion, restaurants should not automatic service charge/ inclusive pricing because it puts a limit on how they can address consumers. """"",,,,,,,

I also stand strongly behind the fact that tips are helping lower paid workers make a little extra money to pay off some things they might struggle paying for. I feel that as long as workers know they will be tipped and how much it will motivate them to work at their best because they know they'll get a reward. Another reason is limited tips will argue against those who believe that tips only attract younger, part-time and less professional workers to tipped occupations simply because it would rather instead attract the former workers allowing them to perform better service.

By removing tipping your simply removing the majority of cost that low to medium waiters and waitresses look forward to. Majority of their pay is based off tips and that's how they survive.
 When you come to the idea should tipping be removed as a whole and other ideas are implied such as the inclusive tipping how do you think that goes. "" I found that customers rated Joe's Crab Shack restaurants higher - by about a third of a point on a five-point scale - when they operated under tipping,"" by this standpoint people like when tipping is apart of the equation then removed. And when you have inclusive tipping you are removing the appreciation and satisfaction experience from customers. And another idea is what if they want to pay a waiter/waitress more than what is on the inclusive bill. they can't tip no more than what is on there or will they be allowed to do so?
 This is a question left completely unanswered because if by example you have the inclusive bill and a person still decides to leave some money on the table as extra for the waiter/waitress. This is still counted as a tip showing the customers appreciation for the restaurant and the service they were provided. Some if not majority of the time this can not be avoided by restaurants and there businesses.
 The worker was never put to this information if tipping should be removed or not, I feel as a large majority wouldn't agree. As a person who worked in a field of dining the workers majority of pay was off of their tips, they work extremely hard to please every customer that comes in just to get a good or decent tip. Even making friends and having regulars so they can continue to have the same income coming in because their paychecks are just sent to them to be thrown in the trash. Getting paid a near minimum of only approximately $2 an hour you can't expect any money out of that on a weekly bases. Having majority of paychecks end up no where pass $10 which isn't a way to live. When working in the field I got told plenty of times how their paychecks wouldn't even come up to a dollar, and would sometimes be nothing at all because of how ridiculously low the pay is.
 To put it as simple as possible I believe that removing tipping from restaurants is a horrible idea and one that should never be implemented in any restaurant. I feel that you ruin many experiences by doing so such as customers, not being able to show their satisfaction towards the restaurant and the waiter/waitress by tips is kind of not enjoyable and in other words can ruin an experience.

 Others may use the ""sexual assault"" card, and say that some women feel uncomfortable with tips. Due to the fact that some men may be giving tips that leads for something else. Which is true, but I don't believe it's always the case.
 In conclusion, I still thinking ""banning tips"" is a bad idea. I could go through the motions of why we should keep receiving tips allowed, but I said earlier. Giving tips could go along way, and it is definitely appreciated.""""",,,,,,,

It causes more problems then it should. tipping should be there for the waitresses if they did a good job serving, but people make it into something else that it shouldn't be.
 One reason i think restaurants should ban tipping is because some customers make it about race. That is not what tipping should be about, they a being racist. It should matter if the waitor is white or black they should still get the tip. So to remove that problem they should just banned it so people don't have to go through that.
 Another reason i think they should banned tipping is because it puts unwanted pressure on people to part with the money they would rather keep. customers already have to pay for the food and most of the time its an expensive place. So i think if its about the waitors making money they should raise the food prices a little bit more so that they can give the waitresses more money. Then the customers wont be paying extra money that they know of.
  I know the tipping probably helps the waitors. But it causes more harm then good, its bringing more problems then money . its others way they can get more money then tips. Im sure the waitors wont like not having tips but if they mangers helps them out with higher the prices a little to give to them, then thy should be fine.
 In conclusion tipping should be banned, to cause less problems at resturants. So waitors wont have to go through the color discriminations or the customers wont have to go through paying more money they dont wanna pay. Just raise the prices and all the problems would clear up.

In many restaurants people are very discriminatory about the way they tip; For example: people tend to tip women less if they are unattractive and tend to also tip less if they're server is of a minority. Not only that, but it also leads customers to often sexually harass many female servers. The evidence in the text that led me to this conclusion was, ""Opponents of tipping argue it pays workers low and unreliable incomes, discriminates against less attractive servers as well as servers of color and empowers customers to sexually harass female servers."" This evidence shows that tipping is usually based on the customers ideals of attractiveness, gender, etc. 
 
 Many opponents of tipping, or the people who like tipping and would like for it to stay this way are the same people who believe that tipping is only earned when a server has brought forth a personal connection to the customers or have introduced a certain personal twist on waiting that made the customers feel appreciative. They also believe that tipping is a reward for how well a server waits on them. Not only does this promote customers to sexually harass female servers due to this ideal that they should remain calm at all times and always make the customer feel right, but also the ideal that servers who are a minority deserve less of a tip than servers who are not. The evidence for this is shown in the text, ""On the other side of the debate, proponents of tipping claim it increases rather than decreases customer service and satisfaction. Tips are supposed to be a reward for service, so advocates of the practice argue that it helps attract more competent workers to tipped occupations and motivates them to deliver better and more personalized service.""
 
 For these reasons, tipping should be banned. This decision would most certainly upset certain people who enjoy tipping or rather the ideal that they can sexually harass servers who they find attractive, but also that they can continue to get away with doing so as long as tipping is this notion that the server(s) should always make them feel as though they are correct and remain calm and willing to serve them. When these ideals are thrown out and inclusive tipping is arranged, you will most likely find that there will be less sexual harassment as well as discrimination against minorities and females in the restaurant business.""""",,,,,,,

Opponents may say that banning tipping is a good idea because it pays workers low and unreliable incomes discriminates again less attractive severs.

Restaurants should not ban tipping, it's a way of helping people out in a little way. When employees are tipped, they get an urge of happiness and would want to improve those people's experiences at their restaurant. Employees have motivation when receiving tips from customers, it can impact a person's day when someone is getting a tip. 
 
 There are a lot of people that would believe that it will increase customer service and their satisfaction. When employees are being tipped they are receiving a reward for their good service and politeness. The more tips employees receive the better they will work, it gets them motivated and gives off positive energy when receiving a tip. Many believe that this would change the prices at restaurants to lower them because they say â€œthey prefer tipping over automatic service charges or inclusive pricing.â€. 
 
 A way they tested this theory if tipping is good or bad was they did an experiment at a crab shack. They had saw reviews on restaurants that changed their tipping policies and in the article it says â€œThis chain replaced tipping with higher service-inclusive menu prices at 18 of its restaurants, only to reverse course six months later and bring tipping back at 14 of the locations.â€. The inclusive menu prices weren't working so they brought back tipping because customers would rather tip than pay inclusive prices. People show that tipping is better than having to pay inclusive prices, crab shack started losing customers when they stopped the tipping policy and changed to inclusive prices but when they changed back customers started to come back.
 
 Many can argue that banning tipping would work because most restaurants tipping policies have changed to improve to inclusive prices to improve their business. Even though most of these work for some restaurants, it doesn't work for all of them, this works for more classier joints. Other restaurants like crab shack this wouldn't work because from their experiment they were losing customers after changing their tipping policy. Tipping shouldnâ€™t be banned because this can't work for all restaurants, it can work for some but not all.
 
 In conclusion, tipping shouldnt be banned because itâ€™s a help for restaurants and it brings in more customers. If you were an employee at a restaurant how would you feel about tipping? Tipping is helping more than just the restaurant but its helping out employees that work there.

In the text it says, ""in tippingâ€™s favor is that it allows restaurants to charge lower menu prices, which stingier tippers like because it reduces the costs of eating out.""

 Restaurants should continue tipping for workers. Tipping workers motivates them to deliver better service. For example, ""Tips are supposed to be a reward for service..."" These tips help workers with their income but also it enhances teamwork among servers. Overall tipping shouldn't be banned because people prefer to tip workers rather than paying inclusive pricing. On the other hand many others prefer to pay higher prices rather than to tip workers. The higher prices will give the staff a higher pay check. For example, ""Their wealthier customers, who are less sensitive to the added cost of service charges or inclusive-pricing, are less likely to punish them."" Some people do have a lot of money and are able to pay these higher prices.
 Are you able to pay the higher menu prices or are you able to pay the cheaper menu prices with tipping? If you are able to pay the cheaper menu prices and tip, the tips help the workers with their income and motivation. These workers up a lot of hard working trying to serve their costumers the best.

With the tip built into the menu/billing it doesnt give feedback. I feel like tipping is the costumers voice. When they tip based on service this let the employee and company know what they need to do and what they should keep doing. My third reasoning being that prices will be cheaper if we keep tipping. Low prices bring more coustumers in. With more custumers brings more service to tend to and also more tips. The low prices also are an advantage for people who dont have as much money. Without tipping, the built in tip will cause prices to rise making it less affordable to costumers. Athough the opposing side (getting rid of tips) thinks that the built in tip will pay staff better.

 When Joes crab shack took tipping out the ratings for the 18 stores that did that changed back in just a week. Because all the workers became unmotivated to do anything good or try there hardest because they have nothing to work for. It makes it hard on workers to want to work knowing there getting minimum wage and no tips at all.
 
 When tips were allowed the customer service and all around atmosphere of the restaurant was better than ever. This is because workers have motivation to do there job good and fast, when there were not tips the workers basically gave up on there work and said the heck with it, btu with tips there motivated and wanting to work because there gonna get good pay.
 
 the prices for food were expensive when there was no tipping allowed making it hard for customers to want to come in and eat at the restaurant . In the passage he states that ""for some people its hard to let go of that money that they could possibly want to keep"". When tippins allowed the food prices are low and customers will want to come in and eat.
 
 On the other side tipping does get expensive. Some people are just stingy but most just dont want to spend all there money on decent food. And at some restaurants tipping goes based off the price of your meal making it harder to want to tip and pay for the food. I know some people who dont tip because they just dont have the money to pay for it.
 
 In conclusion i believe that tips should be in restaurants and that if you dont leave a tip your meal should be more expensive than it should be. Because waiters work hard for there money and them not getting a tip will lower there care for the restaurant and the care of you as a customer.

Although some restaurants already take the tip out, stated in the article ""High service restaurants"".
 
 One reason restaurants shouldn't ban tipping is because "" In the United States they prefer tipping over automatic service charges or inclusive pricing."" Giving a clue that a restaurant always have a set amount of what they plan to take out when they take out tips on their own. When restaurants do that its them telling customers how much they want instead of the customer being genuine and giving them their own set amount. To me both ways are unfair because a lot of customers don't tip their servers and they get paid very little, on the other hand, restaurants take out the amount they don't know that is available to customers.
 
 Another reason why tipping shouldn't be banned is because it can lower how many customers you bring in. In the article is stated that Joe's Crab shack suffered a third of a point decline in its online rating after switching to inclusively pricing. This shows that customers are not used to a change and would prefer taking the tip out on their own. 
 
 Others may disagree and say that restaurants should ban tipping because of the minimum wage servers are getting paid. Many people say that restaurant workers depend on the tipping as their overall income but in my opinion tips should be given out of appreciation. You can take a tip from a customer and you may have did an unpleasant job with serving them. To the customer they don't want to give you a tip because of the poor service, but there are restaurants out there taking tips on their own out while doing service bad
 
 In this conclusion this is why i think restaurants shouldn't ban tipping because it takes away the forceful opinion from restaurants of tipping on their own. Its better when money is given to another without it having an assertive amount taken out. It creates an emotional connection between servers and customers when tips are given because it shows value in what they did to reach their needs and serve. """"",,,,,,,

In this article it will discuss wither we should or shouldn't ban tipping in restaurants. 
 Restaurants should ban tipping for several reasons. 
 
 First reason, Not everyone likes tipping. This reasoning is debate able between most people, however. as a restaurant worker, would you be faster to serve someone who pays you 100 extra USD, or someone who doesn't pay you at all? And so that biased is caused without even knowing a person. For example, Fugal people. Personally I am fugal, And i hate tipping because i personally would love to spend my money on something known as other necessities like clothing and mortgage payment. 
 Before i go to the next reason, lets dive into the opposite side of the argument. some people believe that tipping is required for moral of workers is the workers need tips for payment, but also it is a sign of appreciation for the server. However to detest it is simply looking at everywhere else on gods green earth. which follows in my next reason.
 Second Reason Tipping is not universal around the world. It may come to a shock to most people but in practically every location other than Libera and US America tipping is banned in all restaurants and is considered extremely disrespectful to tip servers/waitresses. Because it is a sign of saying "" hey you look like you need some more cash take it"" which ties into the next reason
 Third reason, is simply unjust in its nature. Take a look out of the restaurant. The chief makes your food, tells the waitress here is order #*Insert number here* and delivers the food. How fast or slow your order comes isn't based on the waiter by any longer than 30 seconds to a minute. Why don't we tip the chief for actually making the food but we tip the waitresses for it. 
 These are my three reasons why tipping should be banned. Just to recap. Tipping should be banned because, it is unjust in nature, it is not universal between cultures and not everyone has the money to spare. """"",,,,,,,

They are not required so there is less pressure on people with less money. Tipping also gives workers more of a reason to do better at their job. While places that usually serve higher end food didn't have much of a differance because most people didn't care about the price change. While smaller places like Joe's Crab Shack's customers are effected more as they may not be able to afford some things thanks to price changes. These people who don't have as much money that they can just spend around might not be able to going there which means both sides take a hit. It might be said that tipping takes away from the customers dining experience. I feel if anything that the encouragement of a tip would make their dining experience as people would do more for money. It is for these reasons that i believe tipping should not be banned.""""",,,,,,,

They didn't have enough money to create new classrooms. Schools couldn't hire enough teachers for the program. They also didn't have enough classroom space for the smaller classes. All are stated in the Reality Check section. Smaller classrooms should be introduced more slowly. in Project STAR, the smaller classrooms were ahead in the larger classes by several months.

Some find it necessary and that it should remain, others find it pointless and think it should be abolished. I am of the opinion it should not be abolished. I also think the article by Michael Lynn, ""How the war on tipping harms customers"", helps support my argument. My main two pieces of evidence are that the service and prices without tipping decrease customer satisfaction, and less expensive restaurants suffer greatly when removing tipping.
 
 Firstly, there's that without tipping, customer satisfaction decreases. This is because of a variety of factors. There's the fact that with the tip as a reward of good service, servers are encouraged to give better service, giving a better dining experience. There's also that the prices of the menu increase without tips. If a customer is used to a restaurant being cheap, they're not going to be pleased if the prices increase. Those are the two major one I could think of, but there could be more.
 
 Secondly, less expensive restaurants suffer greatly when removing tipping. One way is the dissatisfaction of their customers, who are probably used to cheap prices, but prices increase without tipping. There's also the restaurants having to up their employee's salaries, which can be probably be difficult due to not having a lot of money before. The customer base of these restaurants are not wealthy either, so they're more likely to give negative reviews, which could reflect back onto the servers, thus giving an overall negative view of the restaurants.
 
 Of course, there's a counter-argument to be made. That being that without tipping, the salary of the employees increase. Which is good of course. But, as mentioned above, that can be difficult for less expensive restaurants. Since they weren't very wealthy, they might not be able to afford increasing the pay of their employees. So, they're probably better off having tips.
 
 So in conclusion, tips seem more beneficial than detrimental. Without them, customer satisfaction with the restaurant seems to decrease. Less expensive restaurants suffer greatly if they remove tipping for something else. Even if the salaries of employees increase without tipping, some restaurants can't afford to do that. So overall, it just seems that keeping tips is the most logical thing.""""",,,,,,,

Tho can also be used as my counter argument because itâ€™s explaining why people think tipping is bad because it ruins customers experiences in going out but my thing is itâ€™s not like the employees/waiter and waitresses are asking for tips so tipping is not required but itâ€™s something nice to do and it should make you feel good about yourself because you made someone feel good.

 One of the reasons I think this comes from my own personal experience with class and I think itâ€™s pretty good now and classmates actually help and take all the pressure off of you especially if there is more people Iâ€™ve been used to a lot of classmates making a change wouldnâ€™t be better for me. Another reason is that there is usually not any space to make classes bigger and had to take away space in the text it said â€œ Some schools had to take space away from the gym, cafeteria, library, playground, music, or art roomsâ€ which isnâ€™t good and another reason is there isnâ€™t many teachers and so they had to bring in teachers which causes more money and most of them arenâ€™t as trained or skilled or educated which affects learning in the text it says â€œMany schools had to hire teachers without experience or people who hadnâ€™t finished the requirements to be a teacher. Teachersâ€™ experience matters. For some students, the drawbacks of having an inexperienced teacher wiped out the benefits of being in a small class. â€œ and on top of that there was a study and in California being in smaller classes was actually worse than being in small classes and on top of that there was lots of money to be paid that they didnâ€™t have and had to get to make bigger classes and have more teachers as it says in the text â€œ The rushed adoption of Californiaâ€™s program makes it difficult to calculate its true effects, but they were smaller than many people expected. Certain groups of students didn't benefit, and some may have even been worse off.â€Which showed that it should stop as it said in the text â€œ Californiaâ€™s experience showed that future efforts to shrink class size should slow down.â€
 
 â€œItâ€™s unlikely California could have shrunk classes further because it was already so difficult to find enough teachers, classrooms, and money. â€œ doing that made it even harder because they already had the shortage and no room so no schools should not be reduced
