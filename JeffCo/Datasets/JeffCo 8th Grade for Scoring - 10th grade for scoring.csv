My opinion for punishment is like helping the custodians clean up of school for a certain amount of time,or longer detention time. In my opinion as a teenager I think out of school suspension Is a fun thing because I don't have to go to school for a certain amount of time I would love to stay home and do nothing. In the passage it says that Proponents of restorative justice suffered a blow recently with the late 2018 release of a much anticipated RAND study of restorative practices in Pittsburgh schools. The studyâ€™s results showed restorative practices were not as effective as many hoped â€“ or as they are sometimes portrayed by proponents and in the media. In conclusion I think they need different punishments.

 Reducing suspensions and improving equity in school discipline is still a valid policy goal. The fact that initial reforms have not produced immediate positive results is disappointing, but hardly surprising. After all, changing practice and finding effective interventions in the field of education is hard work. Instead of settling for suspensions, I believe this is the time when states and local school districts should double down on trying innovative alternative approaches to discipline.""""",,,,,,,
14945851,12/14/20,4,Mary Jo and William MacDonald Maryhurst,Robert Glass,DFGJFG,Sommer Bushong,NULL,"""Yes I think that traffic-clogged cities are ready for congestion pricing.Singapore was one of the first major cities to introduce congestion pricing in 1975, charging US$1.30 for a vehicle to enter the central business district between 7:30 and 9:30 a.m. The policy had political support because most residents used public transport, with only the wealthiest driving private cars. The tax was viewed as a more equitable distribution of costs.
 
 The net result was that congestion was reduced and travel times improved. Between 1975 and 1988, the project generated revenues 11 times larger than its costs. Pollution decreased and pedestrian safety improved. In 1998 Singapore shifted to variable charges that target congested road stretches and vary by time of day and travel direction.
 
 London introduced congestion pricing in 2003, charging motorists, entering central London between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays, 5 British pounds (about $7) per day. The scheme generated 2.6 billion pounds (about $3.63 billion) in its first decade, almost half of which was invested in public transport and infrastructure improvements.
 
 The Congestion Charge, as it is known, reduced the number of automobiles entering the city by 44 percent from the pre-charge level and slightly reduced traffic accidents. Air quality in central London also improved.
 
 I think they should be prepared for some consequences though.The charge did produce some unintended consequences. House prices within the Congestion Charge zone increased â€“ bid upward by consumers who appear willing to pay to avoid traffic and enjoy improved environmental conditions. Over the long term, the congestion tax lubricated the gentrification of central London.
 
 But this process is common to many other big cities, with or without congestion pricing: The rich preempt central city locations and displace the less wealthy to the suburbs.""""",2,5,2,4,4,5,5

One of them is trying to have a peer to peer or a peer to adult mediation. Unlike traditional disciplinary approaches, such as suspension, which remove students from school, restorative practices focus on repairing harm done by getting victims and perpetrators together to talk.The idea is to rebuild and restore a sense of dignity and community. As an educational researcher who studies school discipline, I think it would be misguided to use the study as a reason to go back to the old way of doing things, as is currently under debate in some locals. Another one is to give that peer a break, like walk around for 3-5 minutes then come back, or put your head down for a little while and tune everything out, but still do your work. Another thing they could do is going and talking to a councilperson, or a school therapist about how they feel. """"",,,,,,,
