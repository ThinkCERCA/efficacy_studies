Some of the problems that come with having summer vacation are that it can affect families of low income. Children that come from low-income families can become farther behind academically than their peers. Year-round school is better for academic achievement and higher education. Students believe that if we have year-round schooling that they will not get breaks, but this is false. A year-round school system could improve the academic skills of almost every student and give them more time to understand the subjects they have problems in.
 
   Having a summer vacation would affect low-income families. This can affect them academically and cause them to fall farther behind their peers. After fifth grade, it shows that people who come from low-income families are 3 years behind academically. One of the reasons that students from low-income families are falling behind is because, over summer break, all they look at are screens or nothing due to the fact that they do not have the money to go to a camp. Also, parents that donâ€™t have the time to watch their kids while working they are working have a hard time finding a safe place for their children to go during the day. But year-round schooling can help to fix the students from low-income familiesâ€™ academic performance.
 
 It has shown that students in year-round schooling perform better in their academic achievements. If we implemented year-round schooling, then kids would do so much better in school and would have less stress because everyone would perform better. This can give them more time to improve on things that they are having trouble with. This can also give them more time to work on things that they like to do at school with people who have the same interest. Year-round schooling would improve their experience.
 
 Some people believe that if we did year-round schooling that the students would not get a break, but this is false. During year-round schooling, they just separate the breaks into smaller sections throughout the year. This will also make the breaks more frequent. This gives students and staff time to rest but not to forget all the material they have learned. This is another example of how it can improve academic skills. This can also give the students and staff time to take care of the work they needed to catch up on. The statements of it not giving students and staff a break has no basis for the claim and show they did not research year-round school.
 
 In conclusion, Year-round school can benefit the students and the staff. It helps low-income families and it helps the students of those families make academic strides like everyone else. It also helps with student performance and academic achievements. Plus year-round schooling does not stop the students and staff from having a break but instead improves their mental health and academic work. This concludes the debate on whether we should have a summer break or year-round schooling.

I and most other kids think school is very exhausting, I could take a guess that half of the kids take a nap right after they come home. So then why just not be exhausted? An interesting question, I stay up until maybe 5 getting about just an hour of sleep and no food. I do this to myself because I stay up all night doing things I enjoy doing, reading, finding new songs, etc. I feel like I don't have time to really do anything so I do it at night a summer vacation is what both teachers and students need sleep wise.
 
 
 The first paragraph of the article brings back memories from elementary school! In the second paragraph people are beginning to question whether summer vacation makes sense. How does it not make sense? You go to school for 7 days a week, Students have to wake up 5-6 if they are a bus rider. If you think that you haven't been a teacher. I'm pretty sure teachers have to wake up earlier than students. The teachers probably want the summer break to. (For a moment I honestly thought that teachers don't go on summer break, If they didn't my side of the argument would be useless but I looked it up an luckily it says that they do? do they? I'm still unsure about it. LET US PRETEND THAT THEY DO IF THEY DON'T, I JUST READ PARAGRAPH SEVEN. I AM IN THE RIGHT! LETS GOOO)
 
 In paragraph seven the seventh grader said ""Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,"" ""The teachers need the break as well,"" I partly agree with this. The part I sort of disagree with is the ""Our brains need rest-"" well you aren't wrong. But what would you be doing on summer break that your brain doesn't take in. You're brain is still holding old memories; An example, You can open your eyes for so long until an imaginary bar fills up and that is your brain telling you to blink because the bar might overflow. You'll most likely remember what you did over the summer break because your brain holds it until it isn't really wanted anymore? But you can't really control when a memory is wanted and isn't wanted. Or maybe you are getting so many new memories that you are forgetting the old memories, Interesting thought process Morgan Davenport.
 
 
 Also! Parents might really want to go on vacation because of their job and they are planning on taking the whole family, They have also considered how you might get a lot of work while you are away and on vacation so the parent keeps pushing it off which ends up upsetting you both, This view of thinking is also somewhat weirdly worded and considered?
 
 Because of covid making it difficult to find somewhere interesting to go for break. Let's just say that this is before covid, I think I would like to go to a carnival in japan thank goodness I have summer break I don't have to worry about school work and I can have a good time!

That would not be fun at all right? In the summer many kids are relaxed and get a a break. Teachers also get a break from school, they do not have to worry about anything. Many other people would agree with me too, that we should have summer vacation still. Others though would disagree. In the text it talks about the different point of views of keeping summer break or not keeping it. Many said both and they have their reasons. I think that schools should still have summer vaccation!
 
 There are many advantages of having school vacations. One advantage is that kids do not have to worry about getting up to go to school the next day. They can have many opportunities with volunteering, and/or summer camp. ""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families. Others may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities. Also when kids go to summer camp their are someprograms that will help you have scholarship opportunities."" This shows that kids can work on themselves in the summer so they will not stress about things. Also, many kids can go to summer school in the summer and learn! This is a good reason to keep summer vacation.
 
 Another advanatge about summer vacation is that kids and even teachers would get a break from school! â€œOur brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,â€ said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. â€œThe teachers need the break as well,â€ she added. This evidence supports my claim about keep summer vacation. This evidence was said by a 7th grader who thinks we should have summer break so our brains will have a break. Also summer break is a tradition so if they took it away many kids would not like it. We always had summer break each year and I love having a break from school.
 
 Other might dissagree with me, and they would say that there should not be summer break. In the text it talks ab this, but they also said that there would be many more breaks throughout the year. I agree with this but it would not be fun not having a break in the summer. ""This childcare comes with a hefty price tag. In its article â€œThe Families That Canâ€™t Afford Summer,â€ the New York Times reports that the average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities in 2014.-----""That means those kids whose parents have no choice but to leave them at home with screen-based babysitters end up performing more poorly than those whose parents can afford to send their children to stimulating summer camps. These two pieces of evidence supports what the other side would say. I agree with this but I think we still should have summer break. I this because now there are summer breaks provided by JCPS in kentucky so you cann go to summer camp for free. You can learn many things for free which is great. So i still think we should have summer vacation.
 
 
 I said what I had to say about keep summer vacation. It would be terrible if we did not have summer vacation. I personally would love to have summer vacation still. My reason explain it too.

They said â€œ Schools out for Summer! â€œ in the text, and those words get everyone excited. Everyone gets so excited for summer and they just want to take that away? I get that parents don't have enough money for daycare or anything but summer is what everyone looks forward to. Summer motivates kids to get through school with good grades so they can be off for the summer and not do summer school and have freedom. I get the other point as well but do we really need to do summer school? 
 
 The other point in the story is saying that we should have summer school, I totally get why they want to have it. Some parents donâ€™t have enough money to send kids to camp, or donâ€™t have any days off from work. In the text it states â€œ Taking months off at a time may do more harm than good. â€œ I donâ€™t really get what they are saying but if I had to guess, I think they mean youâ€™ll forget some of the stuff you learn and when you come back you wonâ€™t know where to go? Iâ€™ve talked about this part before. â€œFamilies canâ€™t afford Summer.â€ for some that is true and I would understand why parents want summer school.
 
 â€œSummer vacation puts children from lower-income families farther behind academically than their peers, and by a significant margin.â€ I see the point where they're coming from, but summer gives kids time off to relax and see friends and spend time with family when they can. Most kids have family members they can go stay with until their parents get off work, others have friends they can go stay with. Almost all kids love summer, swimming, water balloons, spending time with friends, and many other things. 
 
 â€œOur brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,â€ a seventh grader said that her name was Morgan Davenport. She makes a really good point. I feel like when kids are in school too long they start giving up and stop caring about their grades and end up failing the grade. When they have something to look forward to itâ€™s a whole different story. Kids sometimes just like sitting inside staring at a screen in the cool air, and thatâ€™s a great summer for them. Others run around or do sports and donâ€™t have to worry about anything else but the game, no grades, no work, no nothing, just the game and doing your best to win!
 
 This is why my point was â€œNo Summer School.â€ Kids need their freedom from school and all that stress. They should be able to relax every once in a while, not worrying about their math grade or something like that. Also Teachers love summer, not just students. So Iâ€™m going with the no summer school choice.

That's the amount of time kids are inside of school. Almost half of the year! School should definitely keep summer vacation. You're in school for a super long time, plus you wouldn't have time to do anything else, and summer vacation is able to destress you. 
 
 First of all, you're inside schools 7 whole hours a day. There's nothing really fun about it except seeing friends and interacting with good teachers. We learn, we learn, and we learn about subjects that probably won't even benefit us in actual real life. Some of the teachers would even like long breaks as well. They're grading and talking the whole day. 
 It's important to do more stuff than just school like in other groups or in sports. This is stated in the text as, "" Many of these enrichment programs even have scholarships available, making them accessible to families at all income levels."" This supports my statements because you can do what you would like to and have really good opportunities to expand your knowledge and even save money.
 
 Also, many families bond with friends and distant relatives over the break. They take time to do what they want to do like road trips, flights to other countries, and just taking time off and staying at home. If we include only a week breaks, that would cut off a lot of relationships and make it hard to connect with others. I know this because in the text it states, "" When families can afford it young people have an almost endless list of opportunities for camps and classes- everything from sports to robotics."" This helps with my claim because you're able to bond with your friends and family.
 
 Finally, it also allows your brain to destress from exams, finals, and other hard tests. You do all of this hard work just to go back to school the next day to rewind it again with the year round schedule. You can stay at home, and just relax from school. I know this because in the text a student stated, "" 'Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,"" said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. ' The teachers need the break as well,' she added."" This supports my claim because she has the same mind as most of the students we have a bunch of last few days of school test and should take a break from are brains being punched in the nose.
 
 Also, I understand the text stated that lower income families have to leave their kids behind at home with babysitters, but most teens are able to get a summer job or just stay at a friends house. For example, my parents went out and I was able to stay at a friends house for a week and got to relax.
 
 Summer vacation is a really good asset to children's health and it should be kept as a tradition in the school program. It also helps us not be stressed out with our brains rotting, have no time to other different activities, and we're in school for way to long. The summer break tradition is a really important part of a kid's life, because how can you live without a little break once in a while!""""",4,3,3,3,4,3,4

It is were everyone learns every thing all through out your childhood. Schools summer is also very important for the kids. They need breaks for more than two days or they will really hate it. 
 
 Kids also really like summer vacation. In paragraph one it says ""â€œSchoolâ€™s out for summer!â€ blares a popular rock song.. Itâ€™s an anthem that celebrates the familiar joy of that moment the final school bell rings and students are released into months-long freedom"".Schools have celebration and sometimes events for the last day. Everybody needs a break and even teachers do. All the kids want is to play out side and play with friends.
 
 Some students were saying things like this"" Plus, sometimes itâ€™s nice to just get a break from schoo""l. ""Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests'' and this â€œThe teachers need the break as well. Its healthy for kids not to get work shoved in there face and a summer break is good for very body. Thats one of the benefits for teachers! The teachers all get good long breaks without school stress.
 
 Even teachers are exited for school break. They want it because its stress free and easier. Lots of people are concerned about how much you remember though. They are worried that we will forget every thing.But you have to remember what you learn at the beginning of the year you will also forget. That is a lot longer that the summer vacation. 
 
 In conclusion I think we need a break. But also you could forget some. So what I think the best solution is to split summer in half and but one half in summer and the other half in winter. That is what I think, they shouldn't keep it like that or cancel it they should make it better.

Although some people may say to eliminate summer vacation, there are reasons to why and how it benefits and should be kept. 
 
 ""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families."" This shows how students and parents can do jobs for the summer to help others and or earn money to go to a beneficial cause. ""Plus, sometimes it's nice to get a break from school 'Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,' said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. 'The teachers need the break as well,' she added,"" This shows how students think they should get breaks as well as the teachers, it proves how our brains need a break from all the stress from school. Summer vacation is a break for our brains and to do the things we like without stressing over school. 
 
 This evidence shows how we need breaks from school, and to not stress over the little work and projects from teachers, as well as the teachers. Teachers need breaks from all the stress of grading, teaching, and making assignments for students. Summer camps are a huge thing during the summer as well, it gives kids an option to have fun with friends, meet new people, and have fun during the summer without any work to stress over. Summer camps help kids learn new things as well, depending on what camp you go to, but it helps kids get a break and learn and have fun with peers. The summer is a time to have fun and enjoy the time off from school to spend time with family and friends. 
 
 Although the summer benefits students, there are also some cons to summer vacation. ""Summer vacation puts children from lower-income families farther behind academically than their peers, and by a significant margin, "" With this we can tell that summer vacation hurts the children with lower-income families academically and it hurts the children who live in families like that. So it is a con to lower-income students. Also, those who live in lower-income families cant go to camps, camps cost money and those students with lower-income wont be able to go as much to those who have high-income.

More schools are considering going to a year round schedule. This is because they are realizing that families are struggling when they don't have the support from schools. We need to be in school year round. 
 
 Although for some families summer is a time for camp and vacation, For others it is a time where they struggle to put food on the table. New York Times reports that ""The average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities in 2014."" Thats almost a thousand dollars. For some families that's just a dip in the pool but for others this is something they can't afford. This leaves parents with no other option than to leave their children at home alone. Summer with out camps is not only not safe but think about these kids acedmics. 
 
 How do you hold on to knowledge if your in front of a screen playing games? You don't. New York TImes reports that ""by the end of fifth grade, students from lower-income families may be nearly three years behind their peers academically."" Think about it that's a fifth grader on a 2nd graders level because they could not hold their knowledge. Researches refer to this a the summer slide, and it is not good for the mental health of these students. 
 
 Some say that kids need a break from school. Morgan Davenport says 'â€œOur brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests.â€' I don't disagree kids need to have breaks. However with a year round schedule, you will still have breaks they just won't be 2 months long because like Columbus, Ohio, parent of four Leigh Anne Kopans. says ' â€œBreaks are important, but a break that long all at once is detrimental to everyone.â€' 
 With a year round plan you would have one to two week breaks spread throughout the year. 
 
 We can do without summer break. Breaks from school are defianltly necessary, However breaks that are months long can be hard for some people. Be aware of the lives and the reality for people other than your self.

It is a time off of school so they can take a break and do what they want without having to worry about assignments, tests, deadlines, and many other things. But, some people think we shouldn't have it anymore. There are many reasons we should keep summer break like, having freedom and helping out your family. 
 
 On summer break, some kids take that time to work to earn money for their families. If that time was taken away from them then they wouldn't be able to make money to support themselves and their families. Some students also go to summer school during the summer if they can afford it to get extra help if they need it. Summer school would help the kids catch up in subjects that they don't understand with out having to spend the whole time at school. 
 
 Students also need a break. Students spend all year working having to worry about getting assignments turned in on time and many other things. It is good for the students to get a break from all of that. In the text it says, ""Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests."" Teachers could also need the break. Teachers spend all year doing things like making and grading assignments all year so, they need a break from that too. 
 
 Some people might say that having that long of a summer break is encouraging the ""summer slide"" but, there are many ways to fix that. Teachers could start giving students a little summer work instead of them not doing anything at all. If students needed too, they could also go to summer school to help them catch up with everyone else. 
 
 Students spend all year working and deserve a break. We shouldn't be taking away that break. Summer school, working to help support your family and having a break are all good reasons to keep summer break instead of taking it away. """"",4,4,3,3,3,4,4

On vacations you most likely go out to eat one or 2 nights because its not like your house you don't have food in the cabinets and pantry, If you stay in a nice hotel then you could get room service and have food come to your room if you would want that, Staying at hotels is always fun on vacation.
 
 Parents need to work more extra before vacation because they get more money and then that goes to their vacation, If family's cant afford it then plan it for next year ir do a cheap one.

 There are a lot of places that are only open in summer. If people had school during that time they wouldn't be able to go to those fun places. Also think of summer camps, there a lot of kids that love those and they have so much fun. There are also lots of different things that you could learn in those camps and during summer that you haven't learned before.
 
 I do understand that summer break can sometimes make people forget about what they had learned before but you can always learn it again to refresh your memory.

One reason is that kids have fun summer activities that we are not able to do during the year. You can sleep in, and school can be overwhelming and make kids stressed and summer break gives them a long break from this.
 
 My First reason why kids should still have summer break is kids have fun things to do during the summer that they are not able to do any other time during the year for example swimming,
 Going to camp, and all the other fun things people do during the summer.
 
 Another reason why summer break is important is that you can sleep in. Kids do not get to do this during the school year and need sleep to grow and you feel better during the day if you get a good night sleep. According to https://www.sleepfoundation.org/ Sleep is an essential function that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up. 
 
 My last reason why summer break is important is because school can make kids overwhelmed and stressed and kids need a break to just have fun and not feel stressed according to https://www.pathwaysofpa.com/ The day-to-day work and atmosphere in classrooms can be overwhelming for some children with special needs, and a summer break enables them to relax and reflect on the educational experience they had, preparing them for the beginning of a new year in the fall.

But there are some people that don't think summer break is a good thing and school should be a one -year round thing. But I believe that there should be summer breaks.
 
 One reason I believe summer breaks are good because you get a chance to go outside for a longer amount of time. Pool days are the best days in summer. Why not go get some vitamin d while having some fun in the pool. Also kids go to water parks and water slides and all sort of those fun stuff while getting some sun on you. One of the most important activity that draws people's attention is the beach and no one can turn down a nice trip at the beach.
 
 Another reason I believe summer breaks are good is a lot of students that do other things than just school. A lot of kids do out of school activities like sports. Sports is a big activity and kids will sometimes go out of town to play in tournaments and games. School can get in the way of that and can make coaches cancel a lot of things for their team. That's why it's good to play in the summer because school can't get in the way of that.
 
 Last but not least, teachers need a break. Teachers always get tired of teaching hyper students and getting the class in order so they sure need a break. Teachers also can't turn down a good trip to the beach too. I think they like it more than us regular students. Teacher also do a lot for us and we need to thank them by giving them a 3 month long break.
 
 Summer breaks really matter to both students and teachers. We need some vitamin d in us. Students and sometimes teachers have out of school activities they do. Last but not least teachers also need a break as much as us students. That's why I think we should keep on the tradition with summer breaks.

  My opinion on this is that we shouldn't get rid of Summer break and here's why. There's no better feeling than getting out of School for the Summer. Also there's no better time to vacation than Summer when its hot and everyone's excited. But some real reasons are is that a big break is much needed for student after a long hard School year. Also it gives you something to work towards because if you don't pass you might have to take summer school instead of having fun with friends. 
 
  Now I understand why people want to get rid of Summer vacation or break. I get that some people can't afford it and that sucks. Some good reasons on why we should get rid of it are, The Summer slide when students forget everything that they learn. Its especially prevalent in lower income student's because they cant afford summer learning program's to keep there kids up to date on there knowledge. A very Scary fact is that a 5th grader by the end of the year if there from a lower income family may be 3 years behind there peers. Also students will still get breaks just not a 4 month long one.
 
  But even so I don't think we should get rid of Summer break. I think during the hot sunny days we shouldn't be inside at school we should be swimming or playing baseball at the park. Also summer should be a time for fun and playing not worrying about passing a math test or writing an essay like I am right now. But once again I can totally understand the need to get rid of summer break I mean I was on the verge of saying get rid of it myself. I still think in the end summer is a time we should be free from school. 
  
 
  Summer is an important time that should stay a tradition as long as possible. I feel like doesn't get better than that. But also I feel very bad for the people who don't get to have fun for summer.""""",,,,,,,

Schools should eliminate summer vacation as it is defined in our school. The current â€œmonths-long freedom"" is not beneficial to education and difficult for most families financially. Typically, I am out for 70-75 days in the summer. Let us examine how this current summer break structure is detrimental to families and school children.
 
 Summer vacation is a time when most children whose parents work, need either childcare or paid activities. In a New York Times report, it examines what parents typically pay and shows ""that the average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities in 2014."" The article points out that this price tag is too expensive for most families. If children on summer break are unable to go to enriching camps or childcare, the likelihood is that they will spend the time in front of screens. This time in front of screens is referred to in the article as an activity with a "" lack of mental stimulation"". Because of this financial hardship, the long summer break effects lower-income families at a great rate.
 
 When a family is unable to provide stimulating, educational activities over the summer break, it causes what is named the ""summer slide"". This is defined in the article as ""the tendency for children to forget valuable academic skills during breaks."" This means that children with no stimulating activities end up academically behind and having poor academic performance. A New York Times report showed that ""that by the end of fifth grade, students from lower-income families may be nearly three years behind their peers academically. Educational researchers believe the summer slide is responsible for about half the difference in academic performance between students from lower and higher income families."" There are those however, who think summer break should remain as it is.
 
 Some people might say that summer break should remain because teachers and students need a break. As a seventh grader from the Chicago area said, ""Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests"". Changing the summer break schedule would not mean that there is not a break though, it would just spread the break time over the entire school year. This is sometimes called a year-round school year, but is doesn't mean that school is all year, just that the breaks are evenly spread out to help with academic success for all students. A PBS report noted â€œthat year-round schools offer more consistent education, leading to higher academic achievement.â€
 
 In conclusion, this is why we should eliminate summer vacation as it is defined in my school. The reasons include it a financial burden when both parents work, and you must pay for enriching activities or childcare and the long break causes â€œsummer slideâ€ or academic degression. Remember changing to year-round doesnâ€™t get rid of breaks, it just spreads them out as Michele MacLeod, a teacher and mother of two explains: â€œIâ€™d love to be able to vacation at other times of year besides the summer. One- and two-week breaks spread throughout the year would be great. It would help with the summer slide as well.â€ A schedule change is needed, so let us eliminate current summer break and spread it out over the year.

Summer break gives us the opportunity to hang out with friends and family, go on vacation, and have fun. If we don't have summer break anymore then we won't get those opportunities. Summer break gives students time to give students a chance to have a rest at school. They can focus on themselves and learn new things outside of things like traveling to different places and learning new things about those places. If students are left alone during summer break then it is likely that they just sit on their bed and watch a screen all day. Parents can prevent this from happening by putting their kid in camps or summer classes. 
 
 
 Students have many opportunities to get academic help like camp and classes. They can have torturing classes or even go to summer school. In the passage it says, â€œWhen families can afford it, young people have an almost endless list of opportunities for camps and classesâ€”everything from sports to robotics.â€ This explains that students can get different opportunities to get academic help. Students also need a break from learning. But not just students need a break, teachers need a break too. 
 
 
 Not only do students need a break but teachers need one as well. Teachers have taught students everything we know today. They have taken the time to grade our work. They have spent hours planning for what they are going to teach us. The passage said, â€œOur brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,â€ said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. â€œThe teachers need the break as well,â€ she added.â€ This shows that teachers need a break sometimes. My mom is a school teacher and she enjoys teaching but sometimes she just needs a break for a little bit. 
 
 
 In conclusion, students should get a summer break. To make students better learners we need summer break to be able to go to different places and experience new things. Summer is very important to most people because it is the only time they can get to see their family and if summer is taken away then that will be hard for them. It is good for everyone to get a break sometimes especially when you have to go to school most of the year. The one thing students love to do is go on summer break so if that gets taken then students will not be very happy.

No they should not, me personally as a student the only way I make it through school is knowing that soon it will be hot and I can play with my friends at the pool. Also everyone needs a break from learn learn learn test! 
 
 
 
 WE NEED BREAKS. Shannon Ford talked to Morgan Davenport a seventh grade student and here is what she said ""Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests."" Normally we go go go until summer but now since you take that away we have no breaks. If I cut the breaks on your car it would keep picking up speed and you would lose control and wreck. The wreck for students would be not trying as hard in school. Therefore worse stats for the school.
 
 
 
 The teachers wont get a big break either so they have grade grade grade and the give lesson plans and tests they will have no free time. About 4 percent of U.S. schools operate on this type of year-round schedule with periodic breaks, according to an article by PBS News Hour. PBS also reports that year-round schools offer more consistent education, leading to higher academic achievement. Now how many of those kids and teachers had a say and how many like the schedule. You have to make it balanced so the kids like and so do the teachers my bet is neither of them like the schedule.
 
 
 
 
 
 OK I get it if you don't have the money to spend on your kid but that does not mean they sit around on screens all day. $958 per child on summer activities in 2014 is absurd. Look you can spend 5 dollars on a kid and they don't have to play on screens. look give them a soccer ball tell them to play around with it. make them take summer school. there is options you just have to find them.
 
 
 
 That's why we should not cancel school summer vacation. 
 ""School's out for summer, School's out forever, School's been blown to pieces! No more pencils,No more books, No more teacher's dirty looks!"" Now chant with me "" We want summer, we want summer, we want summer, we want summer vacation!

We love that feeling of waking up in the summer and not having to go to school. We love the fact that we might be able to go to Florida or some other fun tropical place. Sure it's fun to have snow days or off days throughout the school year, but nothing can beat summer vacation. 
 For me, summer vacation is like fresh air. It's a chance to relax and have fun. To stay up late during the week and then sleep in on the weekends. Summer vacation is something everyone loves. And like I said before, we need a break. Students worry about deadlines for tests and homework all school year long! Why should they have to do it all year around? And you don't have to go anywhere nice for fancy in the summer, you could just go the a swimming pool every once and a while, or go to your friends house to spend the night. 
 Of course all of that sounds fun, but the main reason why people think kids should go year around is because of financial reasons. In the summer, parents are spending way to much money on their kids. For example, in 2014, The New York Times says that ""the average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities."" That's a lot of money for one child! Besides, if students were in school all year, it would limit the amount of screen time they use in the summer by a lot. Instead of staring at a screen all day long, they would be in school learning things. And you know how the teachers always have to do a review of the previous year? Well if the students were in school all year around, they wouldn't have to do that. Remember that kids would still get breaks too. It would be like a snow day/days throughout the year! 
 Yes it would be like snow days throughout the year, but what about the teachers? They need a break too. They would be the ones teaching all year long, and I know that's their job, but that can be really tiring. And what about schools you have to pay for? Like the private schools? Those cost a lit of money and to have that all year, that more than the parents spend on their kids during the summer. You might say, well then let them have a summer, but that wouldn't be fair to all the other year around kids. Imagine you live in a house with two kids, one of them is in private schools, and the other one is in all year around schools. So when private schools are out of the summer and get to have fun, the other kids have to get up early and go to school. 
 I think it would be best if schools just stuck to having summers off, it would be fair to everyone. And who said you had to do something in the summer? Sometimes the best thing to do in the summer is to just relax, and have some time to yourself. """"",,,,,,,

There are others who can't afford summer vacation,with young students out of school who will watch these children?
 
  As most say, no school for a few months means no learning at all,but there are summer camps to keep the brain thinking and lots of enrichment. According to passage six â€œWhen families can afford it, young people have an almost endless list of opportunities for camps and classesâ€”everything from sports to robotics.â€ This means that students can have fun while also keeping the brain thinking,and not forgetting important information for school. Some could be struggling with school, with summer break, you can attend summer school to learn more, or re learn older topics. Also in passage six it states that â€œ Many of these enriching programs even have scholarships available, making them accessible to families at all income levels.â€ With good scholarships students can get good jobs in the upcoming future. With good jobs comes good money helping out their family if they are low income.

According to passage six â€œMany young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families.â€ Students can take some time off from having fun and school to make some extra money. With this extra money, students can help out families,pay off student loans, prepare for their future needs, etc.

According to passage three â€œIn its article â€œThe Families That Canâ€™t Afford Summer,â€ the New York Times reports that the average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities in 2014.â€ It can take a lot of money out of families. Also in passage three it states â€œChildren spend their summers not in enriching summer day camps, but at home alone staring at screens. This lack of mental stimulation intensifies the so-called â€œsummer slide,â€ the tendency for children to forget valuable academic skills during breaks.â€ With some young students they just wanna stay home and look at a screen, and this will cause them to forget important school information.

That is why the benefits of air condition are worth the cost. I have tree reasons to prove my answer. First of all because giving up air condition can be deadly, also you could make it more efficient for the environment, and lastly so many people use it, it would be impossible to give up.
 
 
 To start off, giving up air condition can be deadly. The text says ""And when it gets hot, forgoing air-conditioning can be deadly. The heat wave that plagued Chicago in 1995 killed more than 700 people, while the 2003 European heat wave and 2010 Russian heat wave killed tens of thousands each."" As saying that some people may say climate change that could have been caused by air condition could have made these heat waves worse, but personally, I think that if more people had air condition, it could have save many lives.
 
 Secondly, you could make air condition more efficient for the environment. Sure, it might cost a little bit more, but it would definitely be better for our environment. The passage states ""Many air-conditioners on sale in India today use twice as much electricity to provide the same amount of cooling as more efficient units, Dr. Davis said."" This proves that more efficient air conditioning unit could cost more but would be WAY better for the environment.
 
 And lastly, so many people use it, it would be impossible to give up. Let's start with looking at some statistics. The passage states ""The number of air-conditioners worldwide is predicted to soar from 1.6 billion units today to 5.6 billion units by midcentury, "" Also, ""While 90 percent of American households have air-conditioning, â€œWhen we look in fact at the hot countries in the world, in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, where about 2.8 billion people live, only about 8 percent of the population owns an air-conditioner,â€"" The thing we could do is help other countries that are not as lucky as the US that really need air condition.
 
 In conclusion, I believe that we need air condition because giving up air condition can be deadly, also you could make it more efficient for the environment, and so many people use it, it would be impossible to give up. That is why the benefits of air condition are worth the cost.""""",,,,,,,

Because there is no school! Students throughout the grades look forward to summer vacation because they will be able to hang out with friends and family, go to the beach, enjoy the weather, and so much more! But, imagine if your summer vacation was taken away and you had to go to school all year round. Well, that's what some schools are trying to do! Schools should not eliminate summer vacations. 
 
 First of all, schools should not take away students' summer vacation because students and teachers need a break. According to 'Summer Vacation or Not?' By Shannon Ford ""Plus, sometimes itâ€™s nice to just get a break from school. 'Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,' said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. 'The teachers need the break as well,' she added."" (Paragraph 6). Admit it, there has been a day where you were tired of school and needed a break, and that's what summer is. It gives students and teachers a well needed break so they can come back and start fresh at the beginning of the new school year.
 
 Additionally, schools should not eliminate summer vacation because it helps improve students' mental health. Casandra Matej wrote on the importance of summer vacation in her article 'The Importance of Summer Vacation to Children's Educations, Relationships with Parents'. She says ""Studies from several groups, including Psychology Today and the American Psychological Association, have shown that rest from vacation or other time off helps to lessen irritability, depression and anxiety. This is a boost for mental acuity and stamina, in all areas."" (Paragraph 12). Many students can get anxious or stressed because of school and summer break can lessen their stress because students will not have to worry about grades or homework.
 
 Many people say eliminating summer vacation can help student academically improve because some student forget what they learned the previous year over the break. But, summer vacation is a tradition that has been for many years and taking it away would ruin the flow. Christopher Newland, a researcher at Auburn University, said that year round schools do not help students learn. Newland says, ""The evidence is that it would be as useful as changing the color of the school buses."" 
 
 In conclusion, schools should keep the traditional summer vacation because students and teachers need a break and it can help with students mental health. Though schools may want to make school year round, there are plenty of students, parents, and teachers that would disagree with the policy. For now, let's enjoy our summer vacation with friends and family and hope that it will continue to be a tradition in the years to come.

 The number of air-conditioners worldwide is predicted to soar from 1.6 billion units today to 5.6 billion units by mid century, according to a report issued Tuesday by the International Energy Agency. If left unchecked, by 2050 air-conditioners would use as much electricity as China does for all activities today.
 
 Greenhouse gas emissions released by coal and natural gas plants when generating electricity to power those air-conditioners would nearly double, from 1.25 billion tons in 2016 to 2.28 billion tons in 2050, the report says. Those emissions would contribute to global warming, which could further heighten the demand for air-conditioning.as household wealth increases, so does the presence of household appliances like refrigerators and televisions, the report notes. These appliances generate heat, making homes warmer.And because air-conditioners work in part by venting hot air outside, they also make the surrounding neighborhood warmer. By some estimates air-conditioning can raise overnight temperatures by about two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) in some cities, the report said. Practically speaking, if enough of your neighbors buy an air-conditioner it may increase the temperature in your home enough to drive you to do the same.The introduction of home air-conditioning in the United States has cut premature deaths on hot days by 75 percent since 1960, another study has shown. That is why both Dr. Davis and Dr. Birol say the solution lies not in convincing countries to forgo air-conditioners, but in making air-conditioning more energy efficient. That could cut by half the additional energy demand for cooling in the coming years.
 
 Many air-conditioners on sale in India today use twice as much electricity to provide the same amount of cooling as more efficient units, Dr. Davis said.""""",,,,,,,

 one of the reasons schools shouldn't elimate summer vacation is that summer can actually provide academic things for kids to improve. things like summer school can help kids who did bad during the regular school year to do better in things they were behind on. another reason schools shouldn't get rid of summer break is that most kids would like one big break instead of spread out short breaks. especially people in college, they defenitly would want one big break. because if its a bunch of spread out short breaks people wont have enough time to travel anywhere with there family and im sure a lot of people would like to travel.
 
 another reason schools shouldn't get rid of summer vacation is that some kids use their spare time in the summer to get jobs. and kids either use that money to save up for college or maybe help their families with that money. or kids could be getting a job to get something they want but their parents probably wouldn't let them just make the money and spend it so they would help with how much money they could take from their paycheck to spend on stuff. so if schools got rid of summer vacation they would be getting rid of another way for kids to make money for their family or for college.
 
 now schools want to get rid of summer vacation because lower income families can't afford to send their kids to summer camps and hire babysitters to watch their kids. now although lower income families can't afford to send their kids to summer camp or hire babysitters but they can either stay with there grandparents or maybe a friend. and even if lower income families can't afford those things they can just send their kids to summer because it shows that higher income students do better in school than lower income students.
 
 so maybe schools shouldn't get rid of summer vacation because they would be getting rid of good opportunities for students. if schools got rid of summer vacation they would be getting rid of summer school which some kids need. and they would be getting rid of the opportunities for kids to get jobs and help their families if they are a low income family. what do you think? do you think school should get rid of the long summer tradition?""""",,,,,,,

All though the the passage said that ""This lack of mental stimulation intensifies the so-called â€œsummer slide,â€ the tendency for children to forget valuable academic skills during breaks."". There are still many free programs you could go to. And not every kid it going to be at home staring at a screen all day. Most kids do stuff during the summer that would help them. Like getting a job or going to a program to extra help with work.
 
   Some kids get a job during the summer to save up for something they want, but what if it was more than that? According to the text ""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families."". I think this is important because some families might need the help from their child to help put food on the table, and if that kid was in schools all day for the whole year they couldn't help that much. 
 
 Another reason I think we need to have a summer break is that you go can go to camps and summer school. In the text it states that ""Others may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities. When families can afford it, young people have an almost endless list of opportunities for camps and classes"". This shows that a large amount of kids are still learning during the summer. And even though the passage said that it all cost money but not everything does. 
 
 My final reason is that we just mentally need the break. Even the text said that ""Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests""If we didn't have a break I feel like I would get more stressed, and plus we wouldn't have anything to look forward to.

I don't think that it should be eliminated because students can get really stressed out by school. Also kids can have their fun and enjoy their free time with friends and family. Kids can also look for an app that teaches you more stuff every day while at home during summer break. Some teachers also say they need break to relive stress or spend time with their loved ones. 
 
 It would be a bad thing to get rid of the break and use small breaks frequently because people wont be able to do things they desire to do like going somewhere new. To get more of an education for the financially struggling kids just tell them to save their money or get a summer job. This will make the have something of their mind for the time being. Also with that money they can just buy tutors or a membership for a studying app.
 
 Also our brain needs rest after a long year of doing work and being stressed over school. Summer break should just always stay the way it is for the people that are nervous and scared from how much work there is. Some people just cant handle the amount of stress they are under because of how many things are going on. Kids also have to keep up with sports too if they do have any in the meanwhile. If you eliminate summer vacation all the students wont have time to just live life.
 
 You might think that taking short breaks is better than one long break but you probably just forget things faster than other people. A lot of people forget most of the things that they learned the year before but that's what tutors are for. You can also study at the library if you wanted to remember the things you did at school. Maybe even download a app for the things you want to remember again. You can also just get homeschooled for a little while when you are at home.

 Sports are an important thing in my and others lives.Most sports are played in the summer and early fall like golf, football, etc.If 
 if you play or have played multiple sports you now you have practices everyday and sometimes twice a day. juggling school for seven hours a day the two practices that are two hours each ,thatÂ´s eleven hours of work not including homework. Thats eleven to twelve hours of work.

 However not all people can afford sports or trips during the summer. Even for people with young kids cant afford daycare. Alot of schools have summer programs but not all.You can also always drop a sport if you want more free time or extra cash.Bigger breaks also might lead the kids forgetting things they previously learned.

 Would you like it if your school had breaks scattered around the year instead of summer break? Well I would; I think it would keep kids more interactive all year with their learning. Also some families donâ€™t have the money to pay for a babysitter, daycare, or camps to go to during the day. 
 
 My first reason for why scattered breaks through the whole year would be good is kids would be more interactive through the entire year. Over summer break a lot of kids forget some of the curricula they learned. The text says, â€œOne- and two-week breaks spread throughout the year would be great. It would also help with the summer slide as well.â€â€ The summer slide is when kids forget learning and their knowledge goes down the slide a little. 
 
 My second reason why scattered breaks through the whole year would be good is lower income families would be helped. Many families canâ€™t pay for their kids to have a babysitter, go to camps, or daycares. The text says, â€œMost parents work and need to find childcare when their children arenâ€™t in school. This childcare comes with a hefty price tag.â€ Also in the article, â€œThe Families That Canâ€™t Afford Summerâ€ in the New York Times shows parents on average spend $958 per kid on summer activities.
 
 Now if you're on the summer break side you may say this way will make it harder on students so there would be not as much academic improvement, but you would be completely wrong. The article says, â€About 4 percent of U.S. schools operate on this type of year-round schedule with periodic breaks, according to an article by PBS News Hour. PBS also reports that year-round schools offer more consistent education, leading to higher academic achievement.â€ This shows how we would perform higher with our academics.
 
 This is why I think there should be smaller breaks throughout the whole school year. This would help lower income families and it would help kids academics. When would you want off from school?

Â¨ Good friends, Good books and a sleepy conscience is the ideal lifeÂ¨. By Mark Twain It relates to my text because on Summer brakes you could gain and do more with friends. Also form a strong friendship on summer break. But others might say something else.
 
 
 Others might say that on summer break you could forget get stuff over time. Or it is pretty expensive to hire baby sitters every day. kids also will have more time to play video games and can cause bad habits. The reason I think my claim is better because yea yo do forget stuff but its really easy to learn back because schools do a review anyways and yea video games can be addicting but there fun so why does it matter.

 One of the downsides of summer vacation is people with lower incomes cannot afford childcare. The author writes, ""Most parents work and need to find childcare when their children arenâ€™t in school. This childcare comes with a hefty price tag. In its article 'The Families That Canâ€™t Afford Summer,' the New York Times reports that the average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities in 2014,"" (3). This is a huge problem, because while people with higher incomes are on vacation, people with lower incomes are struggling to find enough money to pay for childcare. This is why summer vacation should not exist.
 
 Another reason why summer vacation should not be a thing is because people with lower incomes don't do as well in schools because they can't afford summer school activities. In the text it states, ""Summer vacation puts children from lower-income families farther behind academically than their peers, and by a significant margin. The New York Times article reports that by the end of fifth grade, students from lower-income families may be nearly three years behind their peers academically,"" (5). This shows that people with lower incomes don't do as well in school as those with higher incomes. 
 
 Many people struggle at the beginning of the school year because they did not do anything school related during the summer. In the text it states, ""Children spend their summers not in enriching summer day camps, but at home alone staring at screens. This lack of mental stimulation intensifies the so-called 'summer slide,' the tendency for children to forget valuable academic skills during breaks. Reviewing forgotten material at the beginning of the school year can be dull and takes away from time that could be spent learning new content,"" (4). If summer vacation is eliminated then it will give families with lower income and higher income the same chance at education. Some people may say that our brains need breaks from school, and if summer vacation is gone then we won't get any breaks, but the author writes, ""Instead, schools could adopt a year-round schedule where shorter breaks could be spread out throughout the year. This schedule of frequent breaks appeals to many parents who donâ€™t support the idea of a long summer break once a year,"" (8). This shows that we would still be able to have breaks in the school year. 
 
 Summer vacation should not be a thing anymore for many reasons. Schools should not have summer vacation because people with lower incomes cannot afford childcare, people with lower incomes don't do as well in schools because they can't afford summer school activities, and many people struggle at the beginning of the school year because they did not do anything school related during the summer.

 Some people might disagree with me and say, that most parents can't afford to send their kids to summer camp or get them doing things. While this is true that some parents don't have enough money to do these things, there are ways around this problem. Assuming there will be a family member or guardian watching the child during the day, the guardian can get the child to do some ''refreshers'' for school so they don't forget.
 
 If there isn't a guardian watching the child during the day, the parent or guardian can do the helping after work or on the week ends. So this is still helping the child, it just might not be everyday.
 So those are some solutions for this problem.
 
 So in conclusion there should still be summer vacation. The parents can just help the child a little bit so there is no,""Summer slide.""""""",,,,,,,

This shows that if you are a lower income family that your student will not be getting the best education. The only place that can provide that education for your student is school! You do not have to pay money for your students to have an active and educational summer break. Splitting it up into 1 to 2 week breaks results in students getting a better education to be prepared for the real world. I know that many young people use summer vacation as a source of income for their family. But you do not have to worry about that if you are going to school and taking breaks. It is always good to have a brain break for a short period of time, but summer break is like 3 months long. You are going to forget things which will not be good for when you go back resulting in you being behind. School is very important for students education and success. I know the teachers want us to have a good education and be successful in life. Maybe even someday be teaching your own students. I know students will be upset about the change but they will get a better education and will not forget the things that they have learned so that they can use them in their everyday life in the real world. Like I said I think it would be a good idea for schools to take out summer break. But what do you think? Do you think it is the best thing to do, and will your student get the best education from it?

I believe this because teachers can still give some review homework or passages over the break for students to remember things they have learned, and plus it's not the same when you have longer breaks that just cut off school days. It's basically just having work for a few days, then a giant break, then the same cycle. That would be kind of stressful depending on how you're organized. And also, some kids want or even need to earn some money during summer vacation. Imagine having to deal with work and school stress at the same time, you would either fail some classes or get fired. I'm not changing long time traditions just because this is a ""new era"" and that's ""outdated"", that's ridiculous. Adding onto what you said about the screens, yes it is true that they spend more time on screens. But, that can be beneficial. For example, in my free time I research some history and read about it. I'm doing English, and history at once. And video games can also improve motor skills and coordination, and also patience. You can also learn social skills on them. Of course there are downsides to this, but you act like all screen time will not benefit a child. Texting is also an easy, (and safe, because of this pandemic), way of communication.

I believe that all schools should eliminate summer break and have year long school instead. Not having summer vacation, keeps kids off of screens for much less time, allow kids to retain the knowledge they have gotten, and kids would get more breaks throughout the school year. 
 
 The New York Times reported that parents planned to spend around $958 per child for summer camp in 2014. Many families cannot afford to spend that much in camps. This leaves their kids at home with a babysitter (that is much cheaper than camps) that will most likely allow the child to be on their screens for hours at a time. With summer being months long, being on screens everyday for several hours is bad for kids. If summer was only 1-3 weeks every couple of months, it wouldn't be such a big deal. 
 
 During summer, kids start to go into something called the ""summer slide."" The summer slide means that kids start to forget everything they have learned throughout the school year from the ""lack of mental stimulation."" With the many months kids have off school kids' their brains are not being challenged the way they used to be, especially when kids don't go to camps. Camps keep kids' minds moving and learning. The New York Times article reports that students from lower income families by 5th grade may nearly be three years behind the higher income families. Parents would have to pay for much less camps for their kids. Even if the kids couldn't afford to go to camps, a couple weeks without school is better than a couple months. 
 
 With no summer break, there would be more break throughout the school year. Studies have shown that kids need to have a break from school every couple of months. With all around school, their is more breaks, more frequently. 
 
 Some people may say that they enjoy being able to go to the lake every weekend with their friends, but unlike schools that have summer breaks, the spring breaks are double or triple that. Kids would be able to go on longer vacations multiple times a year, instead of just once in the summer.
 
 In conclusion, schools should eliminate summer vacation. Kids would be able to protect their eyes (from staying off screen time), retain and keep the knowledge they have gotten, and have longer breaks year round more frequently. I know I would vote for more breaks more frequently any chance that I got.

Also, in The New York Times article it states that, ""by the end of fifth grad, students from lower-income families may be nearly three years behind their peers academically,"" this shows how much summer can effect lower-income students. Canceling summer vacation wouldn't mean that we wouldn't have breaks, because instead schools would offer shorter breaks spread through out the year. Teacher and mother, Michele Macleod says, ""Iâ€™d love to be able to vacation at other times of year besides the summer. One- and two-week breaks spread throughout the year would be great.

Kids just sit at home. It can cause summer brain drain. Lower income families can't afford to give there kids activities to do. 
 
 One reason schools should eliminate summer vacation is because kids just sit at home for a long period of time just looking at their screens. The text states, ""That means those kids whose parents have no choice but to leave them at home with screen-based babysitters regularly."" This shows that kids , in lower income families, are just staying home all day looking at a screen. I know personally that looking at a screen a day gets boring. They is only so much videos and games that eventually it gets really boring. 
 
 Another reason schools should eliminate summer vacation is because of summer brain drain. Because kids are staying home all day, they are not using there brain. The text states, ""This lack of mental stimulation intensifies the so-called â€œsummer slide,â€ the tendency for children to forget valuable academic skills during breaks. Reviewing forgotten material at the beginning of the school year can be dull and takes away from time that could be spent learning new content. "" This illustrates that this long break is terrible for education. Kids need constant learning. The long summer break is not helping with that problem. 
 
 Finally, schools should eliminate summer vacation is because of how expensive it can be. During summer people normally go on vacation and go to camps. Those are all very expensive. The text said, ""This childcare comes with a hefty price tag. In its article â€œThe Families That Canâ€™t Afford Summer,â€ the New York Times reports that the average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities in 2014."" That is a lot of money. Imagine having a big family and making low income. You do not want to sit at home all day, but activities are expensive. 
 
 People might say that this means student would never have a break. But we can give students smaller breaks more regularly than once for a long time. This means less money to send, better for education, and less time looking at screens. I think that schools should eliminate summer vacation. """"",,,,,,,

In my opinion, no. Even though it comes at inequality with poor and rich families, they could have a sibling/guardian help teach the child over summer, possibly helping him to be ahead. They could also print out worksheets for the children to do and complete while they work. Another point is many young adults/parents work over the summer, so eliminating that could mean the family would not have enough money to support themselves. In the text it states, ""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families."" This is also the time when many relatives visit children, so eliminating that could mean the time they are there, they wouldn't be able to spend as much time together. The shorter breaks could also mean that the children would get overwhelmed due to all the breaks. The year round schedule would also mean kids would get more work, and many already don't like doing the work they have now. This also wouldn't work out because kids treat summer as a time for relaxation, and a time to have fun before going back. Being in school during that could mean they could start slacking off because they just want to go home. Kids also want to not have to worry about homework, or any deadlines over the summer. A counter argument could be that they forget the material over summer, but as I said earlier in the passage, that is because the parents don't want to simply give their children work pages to do over summer to stay up to date, and make them read a couple books.

If you are working a minimal wage job (9.15$) in Louisville,KY 8 hours a day 5 days a week for a week and a half you would be able to cover this cost.

Summer is a time that has always been for taking a break from school, a time to relax. Sometimes school stresses people out, and it isn't good for them to be stressed 24/7. Even when summer break is over, and we go back to school, we get reminded of things that we know already, and its always a good thing to be reminded about it, because it can help us reflect on the things we know, and the things we forgot. When we have little breaks, they aren't as long as summer break is, and sometimes its best to have long breaks. Some people think we just sit around, but with some people, such as me, actually go outside, exercise around, and enjoy the weather. I am a outdoors person, so I love going out whenever I have the chance, and summer gives me the perfect chance to do that! Once again, schools shouldn't eliminate summer vacation because sometimes schools stress us out, and it isn't healthy for us to always be stressed, and summer is a time to get out and get away from summer.""""",,,,,,,

Others may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities."" Summer break allows students to take some time off to work on themselves. It also allows them to have plenty of time support their family and themselves . Furthermore, a lot of programs come out that season that allows children to better their skills and get the help that they need.Continuing , in ""Summer Vacation or Not?"", the text states,""Plus, sometimes itâ€™s nice to just get a break from school. â€œOur brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,â€ said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. â€œThe teachers need the break as well,â€ she added."" Students need to unwind from the stress ins school so they can preform better and be stress free and happy when they go back to school. Also, teachers and staff members need a break because they do a lot of preparation for the school and not giving them the long break that the deserve, can lead to stress and them quitting. Others may say that students/staff members don't need beak because it can cause them to become dull and forget about the materials they have learned during school year which can lead them to poor retention and results, but in a scientific and psychological study, it shows that people are more like to do well in their job or school when their brain is not active all the time, and they are not a workaholic. Also, the brain needs to unwind so it can take up more information instead of taking up too much info and end up losing most of the things they have learned. Moreover, schools shouldn't eliminate summer vacation.""""",,,,,,,

 Mostly in India, China and Indonasia, it is very hot, so you need to at least have an air-conditioner. The best way would be to have air conditioners, that are energy efficient. This would give us the benefits of cooling and also not harm the environment as much as it does today.
 
 Currently in India, the air conditioners use twice the energy to provide the required cooling which harms the environment.
 I agree with the solution given by Dr Davis and Dr Birol, in the text saying that we cannot take away the air conditioners in full from all the countries, but we can improve the air conditioners by making them more energy efficient. This will give the people in countries like India,China and Indonasia, where it is so hot sometimes, the benefit of cooling and also helping the environment.

 The one idea of this change in schooling is that so parents don't spend as much money and with the summer not having long breaks that don't have time to go on vacation and thus not spend money for their child or on vacation or even themselves (which honestly is quite funny).
 
 Another point to changing to no summer break for schooling is that it would make breaks in between school weeks longer and you could spend more time with your family on the weekend not only that but it would help you adjust to going back to school the next school year because you have a short time span so you would not wait to do things and you would already have stuff that would work for you because you had stuff that would work with you for next school year.
 
 I do understand why people don't won't to change to this new school style because it would take a lot of time to do so (adjust) and people prefer having long breaks because humans are usually lazy and don't like to work and we try to make this new schedule so that the students don't be lazy and work hard as adults and get a great and maybe we should also change to charter schools instead of public schools because they are way more cost effective then public schools.

Even though, summer vacation has been one of the longest going school traditions, it's starting to effect everyone, including parents. For the longest, all schools have had a 2-3 month summer break, while kids may enjoy the freedom and the lack of school work; parents are continuing to struggle during these long months of summer heat. Firstly, low-income working parents are struggling to find and afford childcare during the summer. This not only drains the parent mentally but also financially. While high-income working parents can afford childcare during the summer, such as summer camps and other enriching activities; this leaves the high-income student more academically advanced than the low-income student. This causes different levels of academics which would be hard to keep up during the school year. Leading on to another reason why schools should eliminate summer vacation is because the ""summer slide"". The ""summer slide"" is the tendency for students to forget valuable information and academic skills. Inferencing the summer 'slide', all the built up knowledge from past school years goes down the drain - like going down a slide. 
 
 While others may argue that students need a break, elimainating summer vacation does not mean there will be no break at all. Instead of a 2-3 long month period; shorter, year-round breaks would be included. This indicates more frequent breaks that appeal to many parents. Instead of having to worry about when and how to afford childcare. Nearly 4% of the U.S schools operate on this type of schedule, according to PBS News Hour; these schools have more of a consistent education and higher academic achievements. 
 
 Whether or not schools eliminate or continue the on-going tradition of summer break; academics come first in most schools. Eliminating summer break will hugely increase academic achievement, education, and stats.""""",,,,,,,

I believe this because summer is like a big reward for students since they made it through the school year. If schools got rid of summer break and made a lot of small breaks the students would get used to it, then getting to the ""end"" of the school year wouldn't be as rewarding.
 
 Summer break shouldn't be eliminated because the students would have as much time to do what they want and that's the fun of summer break. Summer break is meant to give your brain a break for 2 months before starting the next school year. Also it only takes like 2-3 days to refresh the students memory on the contents of class. Sure, the break isn't required but it's much nicer to get one big break instead of a bunch of little breaks.
 
 You might be thinking ""Summer can make kids forget content they learned in the previous school year."" While you are correct, like I said earlier it only takes 2-3 total days to relearn the content from last year. You might also say ""Paying someone to look over your kids is expensive."" but a babysitter would be less expensive than a daycare.
 
 I believe schools should not get rid of summer break since it gets rid of a well-deserved reward for the students. It also makes it so the kids won't have the same excitement from finishing the school year. That is why schools shouldn't get rid of summer break.""""",,,,,,,

 First, summer break allows time for students to relax and be happy that they don't have schools to worry about. If Summer break was eliminated, students may be more stressed with all of the constant work and this may cause them to do worse on school then they would if they took a couple month break. This is because this much stress is not good for kids.
 Secondly, Many students use their summer time to earn money at jobs, to either save or put the money towards something they wanna buy. Taking away a summer break would not allow students to do this so I think that is not very fair.
 Lastly, It is also not fair to camp employees. There amount of work would drop so much and they may not be able to make enough money. It is not Fair to take away someone else's job.

The article just made it so much easier to write about how we shouldnâ€™t have summer break.
 
 Schools should eliminate summer break because summer vacation puts kids from lower income families behind those from higher income families, childcare costs, and we would be able to have a schedule with breaks throughout the school year. 
 Summer break puts kids from lower income families behind those from higher income families. Kids from higher income families have more opportunities to go to enriching summer camps. Kids from lower income families often canâ€™t afford those enriching summer camps and spend their summer vacation staring at screens. Staring at screens for that long can be bad for your health and can cause something called the summer slide. The summer slide is the tendency for children to forget valuable academic skills during breaks. Summer vacation contributes to inequality. 
 Summer break makes parents pay childcare costs. Childcare costs can be pretty expensive. In 2014 the average parent planned to spend $958 per child. That means that in a family with 2 kids, parents would be spending 1918 over summer break! Thatâ€™s a LOT of money. Especially for lower income families. 
 Even if we tools summer break away we would still be able to spread those weeks across the year. People would be able to go on vacation anytime of the year instead of just summer. Spreading the breaks out would also help with the â€œSummer slideâ€. We would be able to spend less time reviewing topics from last school year and more time learning new things. 
 In conclusion, schools should eliminate summer break. Summer break causes a lot of problems and without it, we would save parents money, we would be more fair to lower income families, and we would have breaks all across the year. This is why we should eliminate summer break.

The second reason why I think this is many people continue to do academical activities in the summer. The final reason why I think this is kids and teacher's need breaks from the stress caused by school. 
 
 The first reason why I believe that we should not cancel summer break is it has gotten to the point where it is like a tradition. The passage states, "" Itâ€™s an anthem that celebrates the familiar joy of that moment the final school bell rings and students are released into months-long freedom."" This makes sense to me because it says familiar joy . Which to me makes it seem like it is a tradition. Also the word joy makes it sound like summer break is something that the kids look forward to. Meaning that they enjoy this ""tradition"". 
 
 The Next reason why I believe that they should keep summer break is many people continue to do academical activities. For example the passage states , Â¨Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families. Others may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities.Â¨ This proves to me that students are still expanding their knowledge outside of school during the summer ,because some students are learning things that they might not have learned about in school ranging from sports to robotics. Where Some other kids apply real world skills at jobs and make money for themselves and/or their families. 
 
 The third and final reason why I believe that summer break should stay is kids and teacher's need breaks from the stress caused by school. In the passage it states, Â¨ sometimes itâ€™s nice to just get a break from school. â€œOur brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,â€ said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. â€œThe teachers need the break as well,â€ she added.Â¨ To me this means that she is saying that our brains need a break from all the stress and worrying about doing good in school. She is also saying that the teacherÂ´s need breaks from creating lessons for us and grading work. Which is basically saying that summer break is a good way to relieve everyone`s stress over school.
 
 Some people may argue with me when I say I believe that they should keep summer break because many people continue to do academical activities by saying that not everyone can afford enrichment opportunities. While this may be true there are other ways that you can get into these things beside paying. For example , the text says,Â¨Many of these enriching programs even have scholarships available, making them accessible to families at all income levels.Â¨ This proves to me that even people whoÂ´s families are low income are still able to get into/use these enrichment opportunities. 
 
 I hope that maybe I was able to change your opinion on whether or not we should have summer break by explaining to you that summer vacation is like a tradition, many people continue to do academical activities in the summer, and kids and teacher's need breaks from the stress caused by school. So ,Now that you read my opinion, Do you think that schools should eliminate summer vacation?

The text states, ""Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and test,"" said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area.""

 Secondly, eliminating summer breaks would hurt the families that count on older kids to get summer jobs to help with family income.

 Thirdly, eliminating summer break would hurt kids that go to summer school for extra help or attend enrichment programs. Kids learn in different ways. We can learn from attending summer camps and doing hands on activities. From the article, "" Others may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities. When families, can afford it, young people have an almost endless list of opportunities for camps and classes. - everything from sports to robotics.""
 
 A counter claim is that kids in lower-income families are falling behind. From the article, "" This lack of mental stimulation intensifies the so-called ""summer slide,"" the tendency for children to forget valuable academic skills during breaks."" 
 
 In conclusion, I believe that summer school should not be canceled because kids need a mental break, some need summer jobs and some kids attend enrichment programs. The solution is not to cancel summer break but to come up with ways kids can stay active and use their brain. The summer slide can happen to any kid regardless of income if they spend the entire day playing video games or watching tv. There are a lot of free programs out there that give financial assistance. Also, reading books at the library is free. There are many ways kids can keep learning during the summer without being in school.

 First we have summer jobs. These are jobs teens get to support their family over the summer. The article lists that lower income families are not able to send their children to camps or have babysitters to watch them during the summer. But, with these summer jobs parents are able to help their kids accedemically during the summer. The best part? These jobs are easily accessible because they require little to no previous experience.
 
 My second reason is summer school opportunities. During the summer there are so many classes you can take to be ahead academically, and you can do sports. Also This fits into my point of if you have a summer job, your family can afford this. The argument is that with this long break some kids will be ahead of others. Yet, you can take these classes and catch up to everyone else no matter your family's income.
 
 My third and final reason is that of scholarships. As stated in my second reason, you can take classes over the summer to put yourself ahead. If you are standing out with academic performance or sports, you can be eligible to get collage scholarships and that is every parents dream. All of this can be caused just by summer break when you think about it, so make the right choice and keep summer vacation.

When you walk out of those doors, you are over the moon excited. You know it is summer break and you couldnâ€™t be happier... but some people say that summer break should be done away with. The problem with this is it would take away many things that we have become accustomed to.
  Schools should not eliminate summer break. It would mean students and teachers would not get a break from all the assignments and deadlines, less time for students to help earn money to support their families, and there would be less time for enrichment opportunities.
  Schools should not eliminate summer break because students and teachers would not get a break from the assignments and deadlines. Students can easily fall behind in their learning when they are stressing about finishing so many assignments at once. But summer provides a break from all of that. It is a time to relax and get away from all the due dates. The article quotes a seventh grader from the Chicago area who agrees with this. She says, â€œâ€Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests.â€â€
  This goes for teachers, too. They can get so busy grading assignments that they donâ€™t even have enough time for their own families. They at least have summer to look forward to, though. They can spend all summer not worrying about getting grades back to students, or stressing because they need to turn in grades before the next grading period.
  This proves that schools should not eliminate summer break since it would mean students and teachers would not get a long rest from all the assignments and deadlines because it provides a break from the stress. A breath of fresh air. A time to get away from due dates and be with your family instead of falling behind on schoolwork.
  Another reason schools should not eliminate summer break is because it would mean less time for students to help earn money to support their families. Many middle school and high schoolers come from families with low incomes. So, many of them take summer jobs so that their families can have food to eat and water to drink throughout the year.
  This means that taking away those work hours could impact the studentsâ€™ grades because if they donâ€™t have the proper amount of food and water they may have a shorter attention span at school. They may also need to take time off from school to work if they canâ€™t get those hours during the summer. With a low attendance rate and low grades, their futures could be at risk which we would not wish upon anybody. This means that many students need summer break.
  The article states so clearly what is meant by this. It says, â€œMany young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families.â€ This shows why schools should not discontinue our current summer break because it shows how many students and their families can be negatively affected by eliminating summer break.
  Finally, schools should not eliminate summer break because there would be less time for enrichment opportunities. When you hear â€˜enrichment activities,â€™ you may immediately think of summer school. Although this is a great enrichment activity, it isnâ€™t for everyone. In fact, there are many more chances to learn throughout summer rather than just summer school. They create chances to learn about things that arenâ€™t taught in a classroom.
  The text talks about other opportunities to learn on summer break. It states, â€œOthers may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities. When families can afford it, young people have an almost endless list of opportunities for camps and classesâ€”everything from sports to robotics.â€ It even goes on to mention that students of low-income families can attend these too by applying for scholarships. This means that anyone can have the same learning experiences no matter what income. But if summer break is forgotten, the only big opportunity to learn these skills is at school.
  This proves that schools should not get rid of summer break, which would also eliminate many enrichment opportunities, because, as crazy as it sounds, taking away break would also mean taking away chances to learn. In turn, this would make students less knowledgeable of real life situations.
  Some people may say that a schedule with a long summer break, rather than one with short breaks throughout the year, is bad because over summer, students tend to forget what they have learned. But just because they donâ€™t sit down and practice math problems or read a short story and think about how the figurative language affects it, doesnâ€™t mean they arenâ€™t learning. Students often unknowingly use the skills they have learned at school in their lives during summer break, just like adults do. So, just because they arenâ€™t doing their work on a standard worksheet, doesnâ€™t mean that they arenâ€™t remembering what they have been taught.
  To conclude, schools should not eliminate summer break because it would mean students and teachers would not get a break from all the assignments and deadlines, less time for students to help earn money to support their families, and there would be less time for enrichment opportunities.""""",,,,,,,

 I believe that schools should have a summer vacation because they can get a job and help support them self or their family like for instance a kids parents could be ill/sick so he/she would have to get a job and pay off the bills or if the are in debt they would have make more money so their family can get out of debt or even they could save up for a car which would help them a lot in the future
 so if they got rid of summer vacation it would prevent them from doing all those things. 
 
 
 I believe that schools should have summer vacation is because
 they can use this time for summer school to help them catch up in a subject or they want to become even smarter. if they took away summer vacation it would get rid of these opportunities and prevent the kids from going to summer school for example a boy was really behind in math so summer school can help him catch up so next year after summer school he'll be at the same level as everyone else
 
 lastly I believe that schools should have summer vacation is because they can use this time for clubs such as robotics or sport clubs I know people love summer clubs so it would cause lots of trouble if summer vacation was taken away if people weren't allowed to play their favorite sport they would get mad a cause some trouble and nobody wants that also if they took away summer vacation robotics would properly lose a lot of interest so later in live there would be less people that would be in the robotics industry
 
 although i do see the other side of the argument on how summer vacation has affected students summer vacation has caused something called the summer slide this causes students to forget stuff they learned also some parents have jobs so their kid is left alone at home doing what ever the please and the lower income family cant afford summer school so if they have a child behind it will be hard to catch them up """"",,,,,,,

It caters to higher income families while lower income families struggle, it contributes to the loss of information learned in school also known as ""the summer slide,"" and it forces parents to pay a lot of money for childcare.
 Firstly summer break is great for families that can afford it, but what about the families that can't? Some families though just can't pay the ridiculously high prices for childcare and camps so they leave their older kids home and let their devices ""babysit"" them. Electronics don't stimulate the brain so they aren't thinking for almost a quarter of a year!
 Secondly, an almost 3 month break contributes to a lot of forgotten information. This means that teachers have to review this content in August which puts everyone behind. Some kids are able to afford to go to enriching summer camps, but others aren't which means that the kids this is affecting are the ones from lower income families. The texts says ""summer vacation puts children from lower income families farther behind academically than their peers, and by a significant amount."" The New York Times article also states that by the end of fifth grade lower income students are nearly 3 years behind their classmates. 
 Lastly, summer break is expensive! The New York Times reports that the average family is prepared to spend $958 per kid. In my family that's about $3,000! They would have to pay this annually which with 13 years of school that's $12,454 per kid! This is a lot to expect from every family.
 I understand that students need breaks, and summer break is the most looked forward to, but eliminating summer break doesn't mean no breaks. In fact it means more shorter breaks throughout the year.

I say this because it can cause students to forget some of the content they had learned during the year, it can cause students with a wealthy family to be ahead of the students who are not wealthy, and it takes away possible vacations during other times of the year. The most important reason of all is the students who forget content, because this makes teachers go over the previous years content again.
  The first reason is that some students forget some of the things they had learned from the previous year. What makes this a problem is that teachers now have to go back over what they had forgotten. The article states that this takes away from time that could be used to learn new things. I have even experienced this myself with forgetting previous knowledge. This is how summer vacation can cause students to lose some of their knowledge from the previous year.
  Next, summer vacation can cause students who live with a wealthy family to move ahead of students who aren't. This is because wealthy families have the money to pay for summer camps or leaning camps. Now, when the new school year starts, the teachers will have kids who have kept what they have learned and some who have not. The New York times reported that the average summer activities cost $958 dollars on average. This is how summer vacation can cause kids to move ahead of others.
  Lastly, summer vacation takes away from possible vacations on different times of the year. We get 2 months off for vacation and then just small week or less vacations on other times. This is not really enough time to get there, do your activities, and then come back home because for example if someone was driving to Florida it takes 9 hours or more. Another example is, I would really like to go snowboarding in Colorado or Utah, but we do not have enough vacation time in the winter to do that. This how summer vacation takes away from other vacations during other times of the year.
  In conclusion, schools should eliminate summer vacation. This is because of students forgetting content, students moving ahead of others, and summer vacation could take away from other vacations in other parts of the year. As much as kids and parents love the big break from school, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.""""",,,,,,,

Students can fall behind because they don't how to do work they are expected to do. This greatly hinders their performance. It may seem like a lot but this is only one reason summer break is a problem.
  It hurts low income families that aren't able to afford babysitters. You could turn to a grandparent or Aunt but they may have problems too and they may not know how to treat your child. It hurts low income families as they not be able to afford babysitters or summer camps that help kind your mind stimulated. Students with low income families are hurt by this in school and can't keep up with students that higher income families. 
  Many students would argue that they need a break from academics because stress can stack up and cause severe problems later in life. This is understandable but no summer break doesn't mean no breaks. There would be 1 to two week breaks throughout the year. This still allows for families to go on vacation and prevents unnecessary problems summer break causes.
  looking at the article I now see the many problems summer break causes can be easily solved. There are too many benefits that heavily outweigh the downgrades to this new schedule. I may miss the summer break I have now but I have to be open the solution.

 Without a summer break students would have less time to do things. With multiple shorter breaks, most larger activities you can't do because you don't have enough time to do them. In the article it states ""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families"". This shows an activity that you would preferably not want to do during school time even if businesses would let you since you would constantly mess up their scheduling. Also, this helps them contribute financially to their family so it is very important that they are able do this if they are poor.
 
 Without a summer break teachers would not have as long of a break. In the text it states â€œThe teachers need the break as well,â€. This statement states that teachers need a break as well. They also need a break because, if anything, they work harder than the students. They grade papers, come up with plans for the day, and have to be flexible in case anything doesn't go according to plan during their lesson. The teachers definitely deserve a break as long as summer break. 
 
 A counterargument that someone may have is that it doesn't matter if they get rid of summer break because the days will be spread out over different breaks. I do not agree with this point of view. I say this because if summer break is shortened than it would feel like you are in school all the time and have no breaks in between grades. You would never really get time to de-stress because it would feel like you were always in school until you graduated.. 
 
 In conclusion, I have stated my three reasons on why I think summer break should stay, and a counterclaim against a common opposing argument. Personally a summer break helps me and my friends get ready to tackle each new school year. I hope you agree with what I said, or at the very least see my point of view.

I believe having shorter breaks would harm students and others. Students will have to go all year without a long break, instead it will be 2 day breaks every month possibly. 
 If summer break is eliminated academic summer activities will be gone too. Students would have to go all year even though they are behind academically. In the text it states that Â¨ Other may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities.Â¨. This means that without summer break students cant get extra help and learn new things. 
 Summer break is where most student can help themselves out and their families. Student can apply for jobs and save up money for college. Without summer break students wouldnt be able work and get money. The text says Â¨Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families.Â´. 
 The summer break is when students and teachers can forget about assignments. With the new format you will only forget about assignments 2 times a month. having a year -round schedule will stress students and teachers. in the article it states Â¨Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests, said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. The teachers need the break as well,Â¨. This statement is strong because this is coming from a student that is going to be effected by this.
 Some might argue that summer activities are for lower-income, but as this is kindve true, who said that students could not work on math or other subjects at home. This is my opinion on the topic about summer school. what do you believe should happened to summer break? Is the new format a positive or a negative?""""",,,,,,,
