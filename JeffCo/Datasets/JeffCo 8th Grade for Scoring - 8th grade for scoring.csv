The parents have no choice, but to leave kids unsupervised and to use electronic-based babysitters to watch over them while their off to work. The result of this children forget important and basic academic skills that they have learned throughout the school year. Therefore, schools should eliminate summer vacation because kids will end up spending there summer break on their electronics and forget what they have learned in school.
 
 Students academic scores will decrease as well as their performances. According to The New York Times article,"" reports that by the end of fifth grade students from the lower-income families may be nearly three years behind their peers academically. Educational researchers stated and believed that the summer slide is the reason for half of the difference in academic performance between students from both lower and higher income families. This evidence shows that summer break can cause grades and students' performances to decrease. When the school year begins it is time-consuming to review all the lessons and materials again when you can be learning new things and different content.
 
 Parents are unable to watch their kids because of work and can't afford to pay for childcare. In this article â€œThe Families That Canâ€™t Afford Summer,â€ the New York Times reports that the average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities in 2014. This shows that not many parents can afford childcare and the outcomes of this are kids end up spending their summer break staring at their electronics for hours rather than being in summer camps or doing activities.
 
 Some might say, sometimes itâ€™s nice to just get a break from school. â€œOur brains needs rest from thinking about deadlines and tests,â€ said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. â€œThe teachers need the break as well,â€ she added. This show that we need to have summer break so that teachers and students can have time off from work. 
 
 However, we should still eliminate summer vacation according to ""Teacher and mother of two Michele MacLeod also supports shorter breaks throughout the year, commenting, â€œIâ€™d love to be able to have vacation at other times of the year besides the summer. One- and two-week breaks spread throughout the year would be great. It would help with the summer slide as well.â€ 
 ""4 percent of U.S. schools operate on this type of year-round schedule with periodic breaks, according to an article by PBS News Hour."" ""PBS also reports that year-round schools offer more consistent education, leading to higher academic achievement."" This shows that eliminating summer break doesn't mean students or teachers won't get to have a break. Instead, schools can have a year-round schedule with shorter breaks that can spread throughout the year and you will be able to have vacation besides in the summer. The year-round schedule can also improve students' performances and lead to academic achievements it can help with the summer slide as well.
 
 We should eliminate summer vacation because of the effect it has on the students which is poor academic performances having to review skills that has already been taught, but has been forgotten because of the summer slide. Parents aren't able to watch their kids during summer break due to work and can't afford child care so they use electronics to keep their kids busy. Overall we should eliminate summer vacation so that we can have high academic achievements and get rid of the summer slide.

This will allow for the safety of the student and their peers, while keeping the student involved in education and allow for instruction and rehabilitative counseling. Suspension for minor infractions and behavior lead to students missing instruction time and can be addressed with less punitive measures. Keeping students in school will increase attendance and should raise academic achievement and reduce the dropout rate. Suspensions are not a fix all and often are disproportionately applied to low income and minority students.

I will be explaining how suspension should not be used as a disciplinary measure and why.
 
  The evidence I have that supports my claim is, it is going to cause a poor work environment for teachers and a weak academic climate for students. Also because there has been an increase in academic achievement, an increase in school attendance, a decrease in the dropout rate, and improvements in school climate and morale.
 
 The reason I say this is because in the passage there is more good side effects that happened when schools don't use suspension as a disciplinary measure then their is when schools do use suspensions as a disciplinary measure.
 
 Suspensions that are being used as disciplinary measure are causing bad side effects to schools and it needs to stop or at least lower the rate of the bad side effects. I understand that there are good things about school suspensions but because they are causing poor work environment for teachers and a weak academic climate for students, this in my opinion is bad.
 
 A ban on suspensions also increase the attendance in schools. This is why I wrote this argument to inform you on why school use suspensions as a disciplinary measure should be banned and the good side effects on that.

 The break also allows for students to participate in fun summer camps and classes. some of these camps can be weeks long, and a short 2 week break might not cover the time.

Summer break is our get away time as I like to call it. It gives us time to spend with family, allows some students to get jobs, and it helps reduce stress. These are the reasons I believe why summer should stick around a little longer.
 Summer time is the time to get together with your family and head to the pool, or even out of state. Heck to a barbecue! Over the past year we were hit by a world wide pandemic called COVID-19. We were in full lock down for a few months. This gave family's a time to come together and form a bond that might have been broke over time. Now listen most years a world wide pandemic doesn't happen and we aren't all stuck in a house together. This can be a summer thing when every one is home and taking their time off and getting closer as a family.
 School is 6 hours of sitting in a classroom. Constantly being told what to do when to do it and how to do it. This creates whole new levels of stress for students. Summer break is our break from all this stress that is built up over the school year. Its a time to relax and have fun. This is a time where kids can be kids. If kids are kept in school all year it will develop all new kinds of stress and mental problems that will be to much for kids to handle.
 Summer is a time for kids who need to make money to help their family to get a job. Most jobs you cant only have for 3 weeks or so. These jobs are summer jobs like a life guard at the pool. Lots of high schoolers are so busy with school, sports, or clubs they don't have time during the year to help make money either for themselves or for their family. This is how a lot of teens pay for their gas for their cars.
 These are the 3 main reasons why summer break doesn't need to change. Summer is a time of fun, family, and friends. This is our time to get ourselves together before the next year. This is our time to find extra help for things. This is our time for summer!
 Yes of course there are a few advantages to no summer. For example its a shorter mental break and students remember things better. There are breaks throughout the year. You can take more vacations. Also a lot of family's cant afford child care over the summer.

Sometimes the parents or guardians give the students a harder time because they got suspended for defending themselves. 
  The reason on why schools shouldn't use suspension as a disciplinary act because you never know what's going on behind closed doors.When students get in fights the reason is either they are getting bullied or drama.Students shouldn't get suspended for getting bullied and having to defend themselves. When the kids tell the adults that they're getting bullied sometimes the adult don't do anything or the schools still keep the bully with the kid who's getting bullied.Then that kid feels like the only way he has to defend himself is fighting.
  When the student do get bullied it most of the time it's the quiet kid.That's why the students who get bullied don't say anything because they are quiet and they are afraid to say anything.Most of the time people who bully are popular or loud and who say mean things and don't care.In the text it states that"" the level of willful defiant behaviors and general misbehavior may decrease"". That willful defiant and general misbehavior is people who bully other people.
  Now, you might disagree with what I'm saying and I know that suspension is sometimes a good way for disciplinary act.When kids fight or violating the school's rules or codes.That's when schools should use suspension as a discipline.When students get out of line like fighting 24/7 or break a big school rule that's when suspension should used, but suspending a student for breaking a dress code like wearing spaghetti straps when it's hot outside is simple minded.But when students constantly break the dress code they should like a day of suspension.Only because students need to follow the rules but the dress code needs to ease up on the girls dress code a little bit more.
  Schools shouldn't use suspension because that student that the school has suspended for fighting might've got bullied and didn't say anything so they had to fight.Now,I'd hope you have understand why I don't think schools should not use suspension.But,I understand on why schools should use suspension sometimes.

 No schools should not use suspension as a disciplinary measure to discipline students. 
 
 Schools that use suspension as a disciplinary action often suspend blacks and low-income students. And schools that use suspension often have more infractions and problems from students than schools that donÂ´t. 
 
 As read in the article â€Some officials want to ban school suspensions â€“ hereâ€™s how that could backfireâ€ subtitle â€Benefits seenâ€ ''The strongest and most consistent benefit of these reforms is increased school attendance. School systems that cut back on suspensions should also see an increase in academic achievement.â€ This is a result of students paying more attention and actually attending classes and spending more time in class than they do when they are suspended for small infractions/mistakes they make. School systems that cut back on suspensions may also see a decrease in the dropout rate. Also, if school systems include restorative justice â€“ that is, a peer mediation process â€“ in their discipline plans, the level of willful defiant behaviors and general misbehavior may decrease. This should lead to improvements in school climate and morale.
 
 
 Aside from the potientouis benefits, there may also be some drawbacks such as, teachers quitting, non-maintainable classroom order and an increase in rule violations and more severe infractions, etc. As stated in the Article â€there could be unintended consequences. For starters, the ban on suspensions would remove an important tool that teachers use to maintain classroom order. Teachers frequently complain about time-consuming paperwork, limited training and inadequate resources to properly administer alternative discipline practices. This leads to a poor work environment for teachers and a weak academic climate for students. Dissatisfaction with poorly designed and poorly implemented discipline policies is a top reason that teachers leave schools. Getting rid of suspensions may increase rule violations and more severe infractions. For instance, Philadelphia schools saw an increase in more serious rule infractions after banning suspensions for less severe issues. A ban on suspensions may also increase the use of in-school suspensions. In-school suspensions can be just as harmful as out-of-school suspension if students are held in isolation without instruction or rehabilitative counseling. So the student could be in-school suspension and not be integrated and engaged in the learning environment.â€
 
 
 This is why schools should not use suspension as a disciplinary action/measure. Even though there are as many drawbacks as there are potientouis benefits, banning school suspension can lead to an increase, not only academically but also attendance wise. It can also give students confidence and self-loving. And racial suspension can be restricted by banning suspensions. So all schools should ban suspensions and use less punitive ways to discipline their students.

Others think summer vacation is helpful for them. Students are able to get jobs during their time off, to support themselves and their family members.

Also, society has put emphasis that being suspended is a horrible thing and those that do get suspended are often looked down on.â€œStudent Fair Access to School Actâ€ stats that without suspension not only will economic and racial divides be destrained but students may be more eager to go to school.

 Now so may argue that suspension helps to keep students in line and without suspension schools will see an increase in bad behavior. You could also argue that by having disruptive students in the classrooms will be distracting to students whom want to be there causing a toxic school environment. 
 
 There are plenty other ways to help a disruptive student than suspension. One being having them talking to a counselor because there is always a reason for one to act out.

I the article Â¨ The families That CanÂ´t Afford SummerÂ¨, the New York Times reports that the average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities in 2014.

 Some might say that we should eliminate summer vacation. Children spend their summers not in enriching summer day camps, but at home alone staring at screens. They call this Â¨ summer slide Â¨. If we have a 2 1/2 month break children will forget valuable academic skills during breaks. Reviewing forgotten material can keep them from learning new content.

 Schools shouldn't use suspension for most or any of the students in school. There is also other ways to correct students behavior other than suspending them.

Schools could have this option for students who frequently get in trouble, and for when they do get in trouble instead of suspension.

After researching both sides and reading the ""summer vacation or not?"" article I have come to the conclusion that a summer vacation for students is in-fact necessary. Now before you attack me let me explain. 
  So my first reason is that we all know how expensive collage, cars, and other necessities that come with getting older and living, right? Well a lot of students use summer to work and same money for those things as we as even help out their families finically. In the article summer vacation or not it says ""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families."" And without summer, students won't have time to work and make money.
  My second reason is as simple as that the two month long vacation is just necessary for students to take a break and not have to worry about tests, waking up early, studying, or assignments. For most students summer is a time to recharge and focus on them selfs for a few months. Summer is the time of year where I personally can get enough sleep, make myself healthy meals, exercise, and get sun. 
  Some people might say that summer break is too long and causes students to forget what they have learned and that eliminating summer and just having a bunch of breaks throughout the year would be better.But this goes in to my third reason and that is that having a bunch of little breaks throughout the year would distrust learning. I know from experience that when I am in the middle of something and I walk away to go do something else, it causes me to have to come back and rethink about what I am doing.
  So I don't know about you but I think the tradition of summer break deserves to stay and is an important part of the year. Thank you for reading my argument, I hope that it has caused you to think about your opinion.""""",5,5,5,5,5,5,5

For example, the majority of kids that are suspended are African-American or poverty stricken, are behavioral, and they aren't good for kids social skills or mental health, especially when they are being alone for long periods of time. 
 
 Pros
 Some of the pros that suspensions include are punishment for bad behavior and better learning environments for other kids. Kids shouldn't be allowed to get away with bad behavior, so its good for them to get a reality check every once in a while. They need to be kept in check, so suspensions often help teachers with that, even if a students new behavior isn't permanent. Also, when disruptive students leave the classroom because of a suspension, the other kids in the class now have a good environment for learning. 
 
 Cons
 While there are a few pros for suspension, there are a lot more cons. For example, when using an in-school suspension, kids can be sitting by themselves for a long time in a classroom. Same thing for at home suspensions. With parents at work and siblings at school, some kids could be at home for 8 hours or more. Studies also show that suspensions lead to kids whoa re more likely to commit crimes, abuse alcohol and drugs, and ""spiral into low academic achievement and delinquency"".

It as a very effective tool for kids to be disciplined, and makes students act out less in class. While it is definitely not the best, until we find a more modernized effective way, this is the best thing we have until we think of that. Suspension should be used in schools for many reasons.
 
  ""For starters, the ban on suspensions would remove an important tool that teachers use to maintain classroom order. For this reason, teachers often resist efforts to replace suspensions with less punitive measures."" This shows that teachers really have nothing to threaten kids with when they misbehave, which will lead to more children acting out in class because there is not very much to be punished for.
 
  ""In schools that have curtailed the use of suspensions, teachers frequently complain about time-consuming paperwork, limited training and inadequate resources to properly administer alternative discipline practices."" This shows that due to not having an effective disciplinary measure, it stresses out teachers, causing them to quit their jobs.
 
 ""Along similar lines, though many scholars dispute it, the simple threat of punitive disciplinary action [such as suspension] has been shown to be effective for some students. This will make students misbehave in class if suspensions were to be removed, and there will be more vile acts in class if there are no effective disciplinary measures that teachers can use.
 
 People who believe that suspension should be banned might say suspensions are more targeted to minority groups (prime example being African Americans). As well as being suspended for ""dumb"" things such as dress code violations, tardiness, etc. However this is not the system's fault itself. It is being utilized unfairly by some schools. And most times the action that is dress code violation, or a tardiness, is usually after time and time again. Causing a punishment. However most schools in general punish students' for fight's and severe actions that need severe discipline {suspension}.
 
  Is suspension outdated and barbaric? Well based off of all of the pros of suspension, it is a pretty effective disciplinary tool that many teachers need in order to maintain order and regulate the class. While it may be misused in some cases, many times it is used for severe actions that need severe consequences to go along with it.

 One reason I think the Burmese python was the biggest threat was because in the article it says "" The Burmese pythons that have been released in southern Florida have found a habitat they like in the Everglades."" and "" They can eat anything from deer to bobcats, to racoons to alligators."" Because the Burmese pythons continue to eat all those animals especially mammals, they won't be able to produce any more animals because the Burmese python eats almost anything. 
 My second reason I think Burmese pythons are the biggest threat is because if the Burmese pythons continue to eat the creatures that are in the Everglades there won't be any left. And we usually eat some of those animals but we can't if there isn't going to be any left. In the article it says ""In the Everglades, the numbers of small mammals in the area are down significantly. Additionally, this population loss is not observed in areas where pythons has not established itself."" It clearly says in the article the number of mammals are continuing to go down.

It just gives them a reason to drop out of school. Teachers have also thought that suspensions are unnecessary because of all the work they have to do which is why schools should not need to use suspensions as disciplinary measure. 
 
 
 Since many schools still use suspensions as disciplinary measure many teachers at those schools usually quit their jobs because it makes them do more work to fill out the papers for the students suspension. In the article on under Potential Drawbacks it states, ""In schools that have curtailed the use of suspensions, teachers frequently complain about time-consuming paperwork, limited training and inadequate resources to properly administer alternative discipline practices."" Since many schools still do suspensions many teachers have to do the extra work of filling out the papers which take a lot of time from teachers and because of that many end up leaving and quitting their job. But not only will it affect the teachers it can also affect students. Schools who use suspension can make the students want to drop out. All of this can lead to a weak environment for both teachers and students. But the dropout rate and the rate of teachers quitting can decrease if we cut back on suspensions. 
 
 Some schools say that using suspensions on students can help them learn to stop misbehaving and hopefully will learn to fix their actions and be a better student. But they're wrong, students sometimes don't change at all or sometimes they get suspended for dumb reasons like not wearing appropriate clothing or being tardy. Another big problem is that kids who are a different color of skin for example black or brown colored people are most likely to get suspended because they're a different race. So different colored people are likely to get suspended than white people. Which is unfair to students and schools should use another way of disciplinary measure.
 
 So using suspension as a disciplinary measure is bad. It shouldn't be used because it only makes things harder for students and teachers. Teachers get stressed out and some students don't care about getting suspended so they don't end up learning about their mistakes. Suspensions only take time away from people and it doesn't teach students about their actions. Sometimes students get suspended for random things like being tardy which only brings down students making them not want to come to school anymore. Racisms also happens because of suspension. Different raced people get suspended more than white people. Which only create a weak environment for everyone. So it's better to find another way of disciplining students for their actions like talking to them or having them stay after class instead of suspending them. So that's why suspension shouldn't be used as a disciplinary measure.

This shows how when suspensions are not used, students do better in school since they are spending more time learning.

This is shown in the text where it says ""For starters, the ban on suspensions would remove an important tool that teachers use to maintain classroom order. For this reason, teachers often resist efforts to replace suspensions with less punitive measures."" I believe this is incorrect because while schools should ban suspensions, they should come up with a way to remove students from where they are misbehaving and help them with their schoolwork one on one. Having something like this would help teachers remain in control of their classrooms, while also keeping academic achievement high. In conclusion, schools shouldn't use suspension as a disciplinary measure because it prevents students from learning and therefore drops their academic achievement.

Most students with the traditional summer break experience the same thing. Summer break has always been something to look forward to, but once it's over, people don't get a break for a long time. What if they got another long break sprinkled throughout the year? This is called the year-round schedule, and it benefits kid's academics through the summer slide, diversity, and well timed breaks. 
 For people who don't know, the summer slide is a phenomenon where over summer break, kid's minds aren't being used for academic purposes. This causes the brain to take a while to get back into the swing of things when the kid goes back into schools. This causes kids to be confused and not learn much at the beginning of the school year. If the summer break was cut shorter, this wouldn't happen as much, if at all.
 When stepping in to school on the first day after summer break, there are a wide variety of students. There are kids who were enrolled in an academic summer camp who are ready for work. There are kids who did work books over the summer and remember enough to get started again. And, of course, there are the kids who completely forgot about school and instead focused on other things. Because of the complete freedom of summer, all kids start on different levels when going back to school. With a shorter summer break, most kids will be on relatively the same level, causing less confusion when going back, and a quicker start.
 While some may say that shortening the summer break is unfair, there is a bonus. The shorter summer break allows several two week breaks to be sprinkled through the year. This allows the brain to get well timed breaks while still keeping up with school and not taking the slide. These breaks also allow teachers to finish up grading and work without the pressure of kids constantly turning in more. 
 Some say that this effects people's vacationing schedule or people's abilities to go to camp. These points are true, but typically in a year-round schedule, the summer break is long enough for families to plan and go on vacations, along with kids to go to camps. Plus, with the extra breaks throughout, it gives families to go on vacations at different times, allowing more flexibility.
 In conclusion, sticking to a year-round schedule is the best fit for any school because it helps kid's academics by eliminating the summer slide, mostly removing academic diversity, and giving the brain several breaks. Thank you.""""",5,5,5,5,5,5,5

 When students go to a new school, things can get overwhelming. Everyone you know is at different schools, the new school is like a maze with endless hallways, all the teachers are new and they sometimes dump 10 or more assignments on you by the first week. But, the students face through it all because they know that Summer break is coming. This gives them energy and the want to finish school and relax at home during the break. True, kids would want to play video games all day and go the beach instead of studying. But, that is their choice and their parents. It is really up to them if they want to study throughout the summer or not, but I still think Summer break should still be available.
 
 In almost every class, there is bound to be a reckless student or a drama queen messing up the lesson. Teachers have to yell over the students, chase them to their chairs and give out the 5th copy of the same assignment, and lets be honest. It gets boring and frustrating very very quickly. ""Ah, the weekend is finally here! Time to work on their grades and tell my students to turn in this assignment that was due two weeks ago and I need to respond to this email...."" This can drive teachers crazy and remember, the summer break is not just for students! Teachers need breaks too and this is the biggest and longest one! You may argue that the teacher just needs to work on controlling their students and be more organized. but that won't help. The reason why students go bonkers is because they are bored, don't want to learn, or many more reasons. We can't control the students' brain and tell it to sit down, but what we can do is give them a reward if they pay attention throughout the entire school year. If they are good, Summer break! If they are bad, summer school. So, again, up to the students if they want Summer break or not.
 
 ""Dad! I need help with math!"" ""Mom! I need help with choir!"" Parents must have heard this once or twice and it can get boring at times. Parents want to bond with their kids and helping them with school is very helpful, but parents would rather bond over something else. Fall break, pumpkin patch trip! Winter break, skiing and ice skating! Spring break, horseback riding! Summer break, it is an endless choice of options! But, parents can't do that until Summer break and if their student has been getting good grades. Yes, education is very important and the crucial moment of learning, but you can't overload the students, teachers and parents before the first week of school. Breaks are important just like education. This is why we have 4 seasonal breaks, Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer. Imagine going to school 5 days a week, spending all Saturday on a project, then spending all night on Sunday to study for a test. Students will get stressed, teachers becomes zombie-like and parents are just dying to talk about anything other than school.
 
  Summer break and all other breaks should not be taken away. This opportunity gives students the break from stressing on projects, teachers the break from kids almost twice their height, and parents the bonding with their kids they always wanted. Yes, students don't want to learn much during the summer but that can be fixed by simple math equations two or three days a week, write a short story about last week, plant a garden and label all the points of the plants and go to national parks and learn about the legendary battles fought for the nation generations ago. Remeber, you can learn and have fun at the same time.""""",2,5,1,5,5,5,5

What about the kids that do use summer vacation wisely? What about the kids that need summer vacation to take their minds off school for once? You can't eliminate summer vacation just because there are some kids that spoil it for everyone!
  
  First, ""Many people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their family."", quotes paragraph 6 of 'Summer Vacation or Not'. Although some people say that lower income families fall back in school over summer break, they also need that time to get jobs and make money so that they don't have to worry about food on the table. â€œOur brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,â€ said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. School can affect kids' and especially teenagers' mental health and being able to relax in the sun and not have to stress takes away their mental health problems even if for a few months. We need time to support ourselves and our families!
 
  Secondly, many other kids may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities. Although some kids and/or teenagers waste their summer on video games, many kids need this time to catch up on school work. Some students that aren't as skilled as others need to have the summer so that, not that they won't have to worry about doing anything, but so that they won't have to worry about failing. Studies show that over 20% of students are at least a week or two weeks behind in school and they need that time in the summer to catch up. Us kids need time to get our grades up and we won't let the handful of kids that play video games all the time take that away.
 
  Lastly, when families can afford it, young people have almost an endless list of opportunities for camps and classes. Teachers tell us to get involved more to have a better mental health but most people can't do that without summer. Kids get so much work in school that they have to stress about that most of the time they can't involve in extracurricular activities except for in the summer. Even if we have more 2 week breaks during the school year, that won't give kids time to go to camps, and involve themselves in activities. Although kids that have lower income families can't do as many of these activities, you can't take that away from the kids that can.
 
  While others may believe that summer vacation puts children from lower-income families farther behind academically than their peers, and by a significant margin, I know that they can go to summer school and try to get those grades up for a price that they can pay. While people believe that some families can't afford summer because of childcare and having to work, I believe that those families should involve their kids in non-profit organizations so that they don't have to worry about that. In conclusion, schools should not eliminate summer vacations because many people use their time off to work in order to support themselves or their families with jobs and other activities. Also, many other kids may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities. Lastly, when families can afford it, young people have an almost endless list of opportunities for camps and classes to take their mind off school. Although summer vacation does have some negative effects on families, I still know that summer vacation should not be taken away.""""",5,5,5,5,5,5,5

People have been questioning if summer vacations makes sense, they have been considering eliminating summer vacations completely but summer break is something that should stay. 
 first of all, students need a break from school other than the 6 day break they get each season. Their minds needs rest and time away from school, assignments due, test and constant worrying. This 2/3 months of fun may make you forget about some lessons taught but it's worth the stress relief and free feeling students and sometimes even teachers feel. 
 second, summer breaks give students something to look forward to. The excitement caused by this break is the most a typical student has had during the year. students feel free and they feel like their hard work really paid off since they don't have to study anymore for a long amount of time.
  and finally many students learn new thing over the break considering the fact that they have much more free time. All higher or lower income parents can help their kids learn using internet. now days youtube has billions and billions tutorial videos about literally any topic such as opening the door, making a film, playing an instrument and MANY more, so internet and wifi can help a lot of these kids use their time improving their skills.
 But there are some (not many) advantages to one year round school for people with lower incomes, there is many advantages towards remembering the lessons and higher academic achievements due to this reason. But we have to think of the students while making this decision because we are deciding 12 years of someones life and they should have a say in it.

  The summer drain phenomenon is something every kid deals with when they return back to school after the 2-3 month break. Having shorter, frequent breaks throughout the year vs the longer, not as often breaks - does seem to be a solution for the summer drain. Eliminating summer vacation would also help lower income families by having families not pay as much for somebody to take care of the children while parents are at work. 
  I'm all for the idea but I still think about how a lot of kids suffer from mental health issues due to school. I think shorter breaks aren't long enough for kids to regroup mentally at home - it just seems like a couple days to try and come down from the stress of school, only to be thrown back into the ring - the cycle won't even stop - it'll continue year-round. 
  Then I think about children who suffer abuse at home. The shorter, frequent breaks would mean the children won't have to suffer at home for such long periods of time and can escape at school -so maybe eliminating summer vacation is a good thing?
  BUT THEN - I think about the teachers and finances (I try to think about things from all different angles). Teachers DON""t get paid enough in general, but now you expect them to work all year long. ðŸ˜‘ Schools themselves don't get paid enough either. How are the poor-er schools gonna be able to last. This little paragraph could have definitely been avoided had school have more funding - because they do need it.
  Clearly, there's so many pros and cons to each option anyway. My final verdict is the whole system is trash. Let me elaborate: 
  Inside ONE classroom is about THIRTY individuals. All grouped up based off of grades/performance levels. There are about 5 different established learning styles and each child can only learn at their own pace. But all the kids have to learn everything at the same time, the same way (depending on the teacher) but each child is different so this already causes conflict. Plus schools enforce that children have to memorize instead of learn and understand the concepts that are taught due to tests. Forget about schools vs vacation - there's other issues at hand.

Plus what if you're trying to help your family out with money and summer is the only time you can get a job. I also its the only good break to develop social skill. 
 
 My first reason to why I believe we should keep traditional summer vacation is because it gives us time to be kids and sometimes itâ€™s nice to just get a break from school. Im a kid and school hefts really stressful sometimes but its always nice knowing I have a long break at the end of a hard year. In the passages the author states,""Plus, sometimes itâ€™s nice to just get a break from school. â€œOur brains need rest from thinking and deadlines and tests,â€ said seventh grader Morgan Davenport from the Chicago area. â€œThe teachers need the break as well,â€ she added. "" This applies to both kids and students as she said and I agree it's hard keeping up with all our grades and our dates so having break is nice to not have to worry about that. 
 
 My second reason is what if you're trying to help your family out with money and summer is the only time you can get a job. I know a lot of my friends get jobs in the summer weather its to pay for their food or help out their families getting a job is important for a lot of kids who's family life isn't great. take their opportunities to get a job has a bad outcome in so many different ways. In this article the author states,""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families."" This is why keeping summer vacation is so vital to some families because any amount of money is something. 
 
 My last reason for why I so strongly agree in keeping summer vacation is summer break is a great time to develop social skills and meet new people. Sometimes on short breaks we don't get to see that person again for a long time and summer could bring you and you're fiends closer because you see each other way more. 
 
 I can see why someone would say we need to change summer vacation into longer breaks around the year because you would be able to take vacations at other times and not just in the summer, however I think you can with the breaks we have right now. my family has taken 4 vacations this year during the breaks we have had plus we have lots of breaks already.
 
 In conclusion we should keep summer break because it gives us time to be kids and sometimes itâ€™s nice to just get a break from school. Plus what if you're trying to help your family out with money and summer is the only time you can get a job. I also its the only good break to develop social skill.

 As said in paragraph 4 of ""Summer Vacation or Not?"" it states that ""children spend their summers not in enriching summer day camps, but at home alone staring at screens.""

 My last reason is going to come from my own personal experience.

If I wasn't looking forward to a big long break of no school, I would not try as hard. Having tiny breaks would make me lose motivation.

The time of year every student looks forward to, freedom for a few months. I think that summer vacation should not be eliminated, and is a good thing. Students need time to spend with their families, take a break from work, and go to camps or play sports. These things wouldn't be easy to do if you were still in school, which is why Summer vacation should stay.
 
 First of all, many many families go on vacation during the summer time, where they can spend time with each other. This is probably the most important part of anybody's summer vacation, and if they were to eliminate summer break, it would be harder to plan a vacation. Many parents take off from work in the summer to go on vacation, but they might not be able to take off any time they want. By getting rid of it you are taking the vacation out of summer vacation.
 
 Secondly, students need a break from the pressure of school and tests. Having school during summer can put too much of a work load on students and cause them to preform badly. Having that few months break allows them to relax and recharge for the next school year. Also, students are just finishing big tests at the end of the year, and they don't wan tot have to do more school after weeks of testing. Plus students don't have to spend all summer staring at screens.
 
 Lastly, like I said before students can do constructive things during summer vacation. Many people take that opportunity to sign up for sports or summer camps. These things can help lessen the effects of summer slide, and are very fun for students. It gives them the chance to enjoy childhood before they have to start working year round. They will also have more time to see friends outside of school. Doing things outside of school can be an engaging and fun experience.
 
 On the other hand, you may say that summer vacation causes summer slide, but year round school is a great option and it still provides breaks from school and time for vacation and time for other activities. This is why I think that summer vacation should not be cut out of the school system. I mean come on think about all the fun you had as a kid.""""",4,5,2,5,4,5,5

I think they should use in school suspension because that way they can be in class they can see how to do the work and whenever they get done the student goes to a different room where there's no students in it.
 
 The reason why i know suspension is a good thing to use is because it can give the teachers a breaks and students a time to get there act together and whenever they can act like a regular student they can come back to class. Teachers would benefit from this because they can teach there class without any distractions getting in the way and the students can concentrate on there work.Teachers and students can benefit from this at the same time because they both can do there work and the teacher can grade classwork in peace and quiet.

It is also beneficial when suspension policies require schools to continue education for suspended students, as does the proposed measure in Washington, D.C."" this evidences shows that suspension helps kids and teachers out when they need it.
 
 Some more evidence shows that schools uses suspensions to punish their kids but they don't like it that much because of how much work they have to grade. My evidence that shows this is ""In schools that have curtailed the use of suspensions, teachers frequently complain about time-consuming paperwork, limited training and inadequate resources to properly administer alternative discipline practices. This leads to a poor work environment for teachers and a weak academic climate for students.""
 
 The reason i know my claim and evidence is right because research shows that teachers need time to relax some while the students work. Students can relax whenever they get done with their work. Its only fair that students and teachers relax after they're done working/grading you don't want a stressed out student or teacher because then that would make them not want to work. Being overworked and stressed out from all the work that the teacher's and school gives us can make it hard for us to want to work.

 Schools should use suspensions as a disciplinary measure. Suspensions are used when a student misbehaves. For example when students gets in a fight. Suspensions are used to make students reflect. Student will reflect on what they did and learn.
 
 Suspensions should be used in schools. In this article it states ""the ban on suspensions would remove an important tool that teachers use to maintain classroom order."" This proves that if they ban suspension then teachers will lose a tool that they need to teach. A tool that helps them keep thing in place. If they ban suspension things will be out of order.
 
 
 But a problem is that African Americans students are treated even worse when doing these things. Low income and a other students are most likely to get suspended than white students. This makes suspensions bad for some students. But in some states they are not doing automatic suspensions. This means that if a student does something they will not have suspension, they will instead they will evaluate the problem first.

I think this because in the text it says ""For instance, Philadelphia schools saw an increase in more serious rule infractions after banning suspensions for less severe issues."" This is telling us that after suspensions were banned for less severe issues like dress code were banned suspensions for more severe issues like fights went up. Hence why I think that suspensions should still be a viable disciplinary action for severe actions like fighting but not for thing that do not interfere with learning like dress code. But, you have to think about it from the other side of where all suspensions should be banned and when you think about it, in theory it sounds great you aren't taking children away from the learning environment because that is the main priority right? But, you also have to think about what happens when you don't suspend kids and they continue to cause trouble that could distract a lot of kids from their learning which could cause a lot of issues.

There are many ways to discipline a student for something this minor. On the other hand, if someone were going around and physically harming others then bigger disciplinary actions need to be taken. I also believe that if schools were to get rid of suspensions completely, some might take advantage of that and start doing things that are more serious and endanger themselves and their peers. What do we do now? Schools can't just get rid of their discipline system completely, and we've already discussed how schools should not suspend students for minor cases of backtalk. Why don't we make a compromise? How about we put in some kind of reward system. Something for the students to look forward to and might influence what the school deems as good behavior. If that doesn't work, try a different approach. What i'm trying to say is we need to at least try other solutions. And yes, I know what you're thinking. Some kids don't care about rewards and are going to act out anyways. My response to that is, kids are going to be kids. I'm not trying to excuse the behavior of baby evil spawns who go around curb stomping the younger students (because that is seriously messed and they might need some sort of psychological evaluations) but there's always going to be that one kid who doesn't listen and does what they want.

 Summer break is a fantstic way for students to relax and get a break from the deadlines and stressful hard work that they get in school. Too much stress can take a very serious toll on people, especially youths. it simply doesn't make sense to completely remove the big break that everyon looks foward to at the end of the year.

 Many students in my grade will be particpating in summer jobs to help save up for a car or whatever they wish. you simply don't get this oppurtunity wiht the proposed short break schedule. When you work a summer job you can make friends, learn valuable life skills and of course, earn money. Other students will participate in academic camps where they can also make friends and learn new skills. This is yet another reason why summer break is so important to students.

Banning school suspension would beifit the school system in many ways. For example, it would decrese the drop out rate, improve adademic achivements, and improve attendance rates. 
 
 If schools were to ban in and out of school suspension, it would see many benifits. One of them being that the drop out rate in schools would decrease. In the passage, it says, ""School systems that cut back on suspensions may see a decrease in the dropout rates."" This would help since kids wouldn't feel the need to dropout from being suspended if they were cut back and would be able to be at school more. 
 
 Another benifit of schools not using suspensions is it would also improve attendance and academic rates. When kids are not in school due to suspension, they are missing out on pivital school days and their education. So if suspensions were not used, kids would be able to attend school more and improve their grades and stay caught up on their work. 
 
 There can also be alternative actions taken to help students instead of suspension. One of the main ones being peer meditation. In the passage it says, ""That is, a peer meditation process, in their dicipline plans the level of willful defiant behaviors and general misbehavior may decrease."" This would help to calm students and find a better, calmer approach to handling situations than suspention and cut back on the amount of outburts in the school.
 
 Now, it is a risk in some ways ending suspensions with miss behaviors. But in the end kids are going to benifit from being at school more. And when different solutions to these problems (like meditation) are used it can improve students behaviors and created a better, more relaxed and improved school behavior system and the school in general.""""",2,5,4,5,4,5,5

This is a clear example of why schools should not use suspension as a disciplinary measure.
 
 When schools use suspension as a way of discipline it not only hurts all students but it has a way of intensively hurting minority students. For example, in the passage, it states that Â¨low-income and minority students are more likely to get suspended than students who are white or more well off is nothing newÂ¨. This shows that suspension does more worse than good when it comes to affecting students of different races and ethnicities. 
 
 
 Some people may disagree with the statement that suspension is a great way of discipline for students with the phrase that Â¨when a student misbehaves in class it affects other students learning and without any type of suspension or time away from class other students academic success could be affected.Â¨. To that I say, When a student gets suspended they take a long period of time off of school, time that other students are using to learn and this affects the student as well because when the student goes back to school they will most likely have to spend time doing make-up work without the teacher to be there to give a real class lesson or truly teach the student.

In schools that have curtailed the use of suspensions, teachers frequently complain about time-consuming paperwork, limited training and inadequate resources to properly administer alternative discipline practices. This leads to a poor work environment for teachers and a weak academic climate for students. Dissatisfaction with poorly designed and poorly implemented discipline policies is a top reason that teachers leave schools. Without teacher commitment and buy-in, discipline reform runs the risk of failure."" This shows that if we did start to ban suspensions then it will make it even harder on the teachers and students. Also if the teachers can't keep their classroom in order then this could lead to teachers wanting to quit., and with no teachers then there's no one to teach a class meaning the students education is also at risk. Now some people may say the we should ban suspension and just replace it with in school suspensions. I would disagree with this because even if we did do in- school suspensions then there would be nobody to watch the student which could also be a risk. Also in-school suspension would take away the time the student could use for learning. I think this because in the passage it says ""A ban on suspensions may also increase the use of in-school suspensions.

""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families."" Some families may be in a poor financial situation and having extra income from work is a massive help for them. It also can help people learn a good work ethic by building experience.

""Others may attend summer school for extra help or enrichment opportunities."" This is extremely beneficial for students that are behind on learning or do not understand certain materials. Instead of falling behind, students who need help can use this time for extra help or tutoring.

The Burmese python was supposedly released by its owner into the everglades where it dominated the region and had a much longer lasting effect on the everglades then simply draining it. The evidence in the text states that the draining of the water was mostly fixed in the late 20th century and the Burmese python is more recent, and it's even worse because the Burmese python is excellent at camouflaging with the environment which is what makes it so difficult to catch.

The Burmese Python, which is a popular pet released into the wild, becoming an invasive species to the everglades, or human residents draining the swamp. These two are the major threats to this area, and it's important to protect because it's one of the world's most important wetland areas. However, out of these two dangerous situations, the draining and pollution of the swamp is a much bigger issue that the invasive pythons.
  The Everglades has been polluted so much that even if we get rid of the pythons in the everglades, there wouldn't be a habitat for the animals to live in if the everglades was polluted and damaged. In the article, it states that, ""Approximately 50% of the Everglades has been reclaimed for agricultural or urban use. Much of the northern area has been polluted with phosphorus."" Phosphorus is a runoff from farms nearby the everglades. This means that people are one of the causes of the Everglades being polluted. But it's not just that. In 1845, canals were dug to remove or redirect the water from the everglades. So that's just draining the swamp, because the land was dried out to build other areas.
  Other people may claim that if we save the Wetlands first, there wouldn't be any animals other than Pythons living there, because the invasive species would wreck animal populations. While that is true, it doesn't mean it's not easy to get rid of the snakes. In 2013, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation program issued a permit to hunt snakes within the areas of the everglades, thus reducing the snake population. While those need hunters, there is a lot more work into protecting the wetlands, such as monitoring water levels, and nutrients in water and soil. So, it would take a lot more work, effort, and observation into the protection of the land, rather than the Burmese Pythons. And since it needs more work, you'd need more people, time, and funding to make this work.
  In conclusion, if we were to deal with each problem one at a time, you definitely should pick the protection of the habitat of the wetlands, over the protection of the Pythons.""""",4,4,3,5,4,5,5

However, I believe that we should still have breaks like this. Summer vacation is a tradition that allows children and teachers to relax after 9 months of school, but what if we spread that out. We shouldn't get rid of breaks (other than weekends) because those breaks can have benefits. 
  While summer vacation allows the students to relax, it also offers them time to take up a summer job and support their families. They can also still keep their brain learning by entering enrichment activities such as robotics and sports, as it says so in the text.
  Cancelling summer vacation wouldn't be great for student's morale, as it's nice to get a summer vacation from school. As Morgan Davenport says, ""Our brains need rest from thinking and deadlines, and tests. The teachers need the break as well."" The teachers are the ones that plan homework, projects, and keep the school orderly (as well as deal with us students) for 9 months straight! They also deserve the break. Summer break may also allow them to plan ahead for the next year, rather than reuse the same lessons every year.
  However, periodic breaks wouldn't be that bad. I do agree with the consistent 1-2 week long breaks throughout the year, as it would help with the effects of the ""summer slide"", and still keep vacations, just year round. This is especially shown in the article by PBS News Hour where the 4% of US Schools that operate year round offer more consistent education and higher academic achievement.
  In conclusion, this is why we should either stick to summer vacation or the shorter, yet more frequent breaks rather than getting rid of the breaks. If you were to eliminate summer vacation, at least put a small 1-2 week vacation in place of it.""""",4,4,5,4,5,5,5

 People get a chance to use their time off in order to support themselves and their families. Say if your family is struggling on money, getting a summer job can help benefit that. When were in school we canâ€™t work as many hours and days as we want because most of our day is spent at school. The summer is our break from all that.
 
 We spend 9 months in school and have a break for only 3 months now why would we need to shorten that even more. Summer is our time to hang out with our friends, family, and to go on vacation. We canâ€™t do all that if we have short breaks. When were on summer break we donâ€™t have to worry about turning in assignments on time or going to sleep early because we have school in the morning. I want to be able to come back from my trip and not worry bout that.
 
 On the other hand some parents might not have nowhere to keep there kids while at work. And they might not have enough money to pay for them to go somewhere either. So maybe instead of all summer vacations being canceled maybe it could just be the elementary kids who have short break because us older kids can stay home by our selfâ€™s or go to work. It would make it easier fro struggling parents.
 
 Now overall I think summer vacation should not be canceled because its a time were we get to help our familyâ€™s with low income and spend time with family and friends on vacation.

 One piece of evidence to back this up is that teachers who teach in a school with suspensions have power and they're able to use suspension as a way to keep order in the classroom. Without that power, the classroom can grow out of control and the teacher won't be able to maintain the class together.
 Another piece of evidence is that punitive actions like suspensions have proven to be affective with students. After they come back from their suspension, the student is more focused and controlled, probably because they don't want to get suspended again. This allows the school to be more calm and have a better environment.
 While there are benefits to keeping suspensions, there are also benefits to getting rid of suspensions. It would benefit black and low income students since they're the ones who are likely to get suspended. Getting rid of suspensions also helps decrease in things like tardiness and dropout rate.

If the swamp was not drained, the animals would have had a home/habitat to go to, and the pythons would of have less food to grow on.

If you replace summer vacation, then you are allowing students to get out of the groove of school, and when you return, they are given more stress and usually act out. 
 However, some people believe that replacing summer with more frequent breaks throughout the year is better for the students. They believe that giving kids a two month break from learning is bad for their learning pattern, and can create knowledge gaps in the school year. 
 But, if you stick a kid in school all year long, with more breaks throughout, they will most likely forget more than in summer vacation, because they are out of school multiple times, rather than one huge gap, where they can forget about the stress of remembering, but still have a fully year of learning under their belt.

  Students need to have some sort of negative consequence to their actions or they will just do what ever they want. For example in the text it says ""For starters, the ban on suspensions would remove an important tool that teachers use to maintain classroom order. For this reason, teachers often resist efforts to replace suspensions with less punitive measures."". This piece of evidence shows that teachers are not on board with getting rid of school suspensions because that does not give them power over students and there needs to be some kind of consequence to hold them accountable for their actions for when they do mess up so that they don't do it again.
 
  Another example in the text is when it says ""In schools that have curtailed the use of suspensions, teachers frequently complain about time-consuming paperwork, limited training and inadequate resources to properly administer alternative discipline practices. This leads to a poor work environment for teachers and a weak academic climate for students."" .This again is stating that teachers don't like not having suspensions because there is more time consuming paperwork and limited training and not enough resources to give different discipline practices. 
 
  One last example of teachers not wanting suspensions banned is when the text says"" Dissatisfaction with poorly designed and poorly implemented discipline policies is a top reason that teachers leave schools. Without teacher commitment and buy-in, discipline reform runs the risk of failure."". This piece of evidence shows that teachers will actually quit their jobs because of discipline or lack thereof. 
 
 Now I know that there are people out there who disagree with me and that's fine. You are entitled to your opinion. But think about it. If there is no discipline then there is no learning and the entire point of going to school is to learn so think about it.

 While, yes, the Burmese python have been treacherous to the lives and ecosystem of the Everglades, as they are not native, and are simply taking down the small animal population, as mentioned in the article, the first one was not discovered until 1979. Sixty-eight of these animals were captured in 2013, and I don't doubt that more of them could be under proper supervision.
 However, let's take a look at the Everglades. They once covered 11,000 acres of land across Florida, as mentioned in paragraph two, however, to most humans, they just seemed murky and unusable. The Everglades began to be drained in 1845, over 100 years before the Burmese python was even introduced to the grand scheme of things. 
 Over 50% of the Everglades has benefited humans, and not the ecosystem itself. The dangers of losing the Everglades have been teetering over our heads for centuries, unlike the Burmese python, which has only been an issue for 41 years, as opposed to the other issue's 175. While the pythons are clearly a large issue, the draining of the swamp is more dangerous to the ecosystem itself, as it could be ruined forever, unlike the removal of the Burmese python which could happen given the proper materials.

The idea of a school suspension, taking a student out of school for behavior issues they had related to school is simply idiotic to me. Instead of getting to the root of a childâ€™s problem and attempting to help them find and fix their mistakes, you put them out on their own with little to no direction. Many may argue that such a thing would instead give them time to reflect, but Iâ€™ve met many fellow students whoâ€™ve instead found the suspension embarrassing and uncalled for, which no one wants to â€œcorrectâ€ their behavior if theyâ€™re feeling particularly terrible. Something like peer mediation, having someone you believe equally respects you to attempt to listen and help you is a much better solution than taking a child out of school for simply being a child. When you yell at children or punish them without guiding their mistakes, itâ€™s simply idiotic and unnecessary. Itâ€™s different if a situation has caused severe emotional/physical distress to another student. Thatâ€™s something that needs to be talk about alongside their parents and authority figure, but simple troubled behavior shouldnâ€™t be punished in such a way just because you canâ€™t handle it. A child shouldnâ€™t have to pay for that. Thereâ€™s someone who can listen to them and you need to find that person. When suspension is removed, thereâ€™re lower drop-out rates, and higher grades, though many would argue it leads to more defiant behavior and issues. From my experience, treating someone as your equal is the only way to get them to listen to you, and I donâ€™t believe childrenâ€™s issues should be undermined and just treated as juvenile behavior and then suspended. In-school detention is better in my opinion. Students are likely not as isolated, and theyâ€™re still being helped, not just thrown out of the nest.

Though schools should still use suspensions, they should use them in different ways. An example of an alternative way that schools should use suspensions, is by limiting the amount of days that a student should be suspended. Schools should not ever give a student over 3 days of suspension. This is because having over 3 days of suspension can make a student used to being out of school or class, making them less motivated to return, and this will also set them back in their studies. Another way schools can change suspensions is by not suspending students for minor offences, such as tardiness, being out of dress code, or simply being involved in fight. Instead, suspensions should be reserved for more major offences such as vandalism, fighting, stealing, etc. This is because taking heavy action against minor offences will not create any good, and will only seem unfair to the students, but reserving suspensions to major offences will do good by providing a proper punishment.
 
 Though using suspension as a last resort for major offences does have its benefits, it still has some cons. For example, only using suspensions as a last resort can make other students more comfortable with doing the wrong things, because punishment will be as severe. Also, more students can even get away with doing the wrong thing just because suspension will no longer be an option against some misbehavior. Also the text proves another drawback. This drawback is the possibility that some teachers might feel discouraged to work because of misbehavior and ineffective punishments because of the lack of suspensions.

I think it isn't very fair for the students to be working hard, just for them to never get a break. They also don't have that much time to see family if they are out of state. Another reason is because of summer camps, which could also be good for learning new things and getting outdoors. Here are my reasons why.
 
 My first reason is kids deserve a break. Besides for seasonal vacations, they don't have that much time to relax without thinking about the next week. Also, they need time to go out and have fun after being filled with information for one hundred and eighty days. If students didn't have that, they would be learning less due to how much their brain can hold.
 
 My second reason is summer camps. Students need a way to get outside and get some fresh air, while learning things. Most of the time, teachers and students are restricted to only teaching and learning the curriculum. Some students might want to go to space camp and learn how to be a astronaut, while others might want to learn how to be a professional basketball player. All students would rather learn about something they are passionate about instead of the daily rotation, and this is their chance.
 
 My last reason is family time. I touched on this in my first reason, but I wanted to elaborate. Students don't have any time to see family if they are out of state. Summer break is a way students can get out and hang with their family for more than a week. I have family in New York, but I can only see them for a week, twice a year. During summer break, I can see them for up to three months!
 
 These are my reasons for why I know summer break should not be cancelled. I feel like it also makes school less enjoyable. If students have nothing to look forward to, then what is the point in paying attention or doing well? I love summer break, and I don't want it to leave.""""",2,4,2,5,3,5,5

Students usually don't study much during the summer and this causes students to lose knowledge. This will cause teachers to have to re-teach some material in the beginning of the year. If schools can start a year-round schedule teachers won't have to review topics again in the beginning of the year, parents won't have to worry about the cost of summer camps, and we can prevent the summer slide which would cause students to be on different levels in school.
 My first reason is that summer break causes a lot of people to forget a lot of topics before the next school year starts. Summer slides are the major cause for major reviewing at the beginning of the year. This is due to the fact that most students don't study in the summer, so they lose some major knowledge that would need to be re-taught in the next year. In the article it says, "" Reviewing forgotten material at the beginning of the school year can be dull and takes away from time that could be spent learning new content."" This quote proves that instead of reviewing what we already learned we could be learning something new that we would use for any major test (like state testing or mid-terms and finals) in the upcoming year. This would save teachers the time to explain a topic that should have already been taught and done with. 
 Secondly, summer break has caused a lot of working parents to enroll their children into summer camps because parents don't have the luxury to have 2 months off of work. In the article it says, "" In its article 'The Families That Canâ€™t Afford Summer,' the New York Times reports that the average parent planned to spend $958 per child on summer activities in 2014."" This quote shows how expensive summer camps can be and how parents would have to leave their kids at home watching screens. I believe this could be the case for so many other families. If we were to stay in school and continue learning and being productive, parents wouldn't have to deal with this problem. I understand that kids will need breaks at some point so they won't completely lose their sanity, but we can include smaller breaks in the year so kids can still get time to themselves while not losing any knowledge.
 Lastly, students will be on different levels of knowledge when they go back to school. Students with higher income families will be fully prepared for the coming year and may even be ahead of their peers. While students with low income families may not be as prepared as other students. In the article it says, ""That means those kids whose parents have no choice but to leave them at home with screen-based babysitters end up performing more poorly than those whose parents can afford to send their children to stimulating summer camps."" This quote shows how students will perform in school based on how they kept themselves busy in the summer. With this gap between different students it becomes challenging for teachers to teach when the whole class in on different levels. Some students would need extra help while others are ready to move on. If there was year round school, every body would be on the same level and kids who are more advanced can join advanced classes. 
 In conclusion I believe that schools should go with an all year-round schedule so students can perform better. It will help prevent the summer slide and keep kids motivated during the entire year. """"",4,4,4,5,4,5,5

Considering it's tradition, gives students time to work for their family, and gives a much needed long break. The school year wouldn't be as enjoyable without a summer break. 
 
 The excitement and anticipation for summer break has been around for decades. It's the season for vacations, no homework, staying up late, and worrying about no school. Taking that away ruins the tradition, which although doesn't seem that important, is a valued thing to keep. 
 
 Unlike some families, a few students take the months off to work to support their family because of financial issues. Like the text says, ""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families."" Some kids need that long period of time with no school to fund their way of living. 
 
 Even though some say that having bunches of 2 week long breaks spread out across the year is enough and a good substitute for summer, it still doesn't give students that long time off they usually have. When school's out and summer comes around, kids don't have to worry about deadlines, homework, projects, etc. But when you have those 2 week long breaks, kids still worry about going back after that short break is over and can never really relax.

The author says that behavior at school becomes worse when they banned suspensions for less severe issues, while this is a valid point to want to keep them, you have to think about the further consequences of being suspended. This text also says how low-income black and brown students are the majority of suspensions. Another problem that comes with that is that most of these students come from low-class families. They already have real-world issues stressing them so when you add their kid getting taken out of school you make it worse for the student and family. You could argue and say this is good since the kid gets disciplined accordingly and stops them from acting out. In reality, this worsens a kid's relationship with their parents and gives them a reason to wanna act out at school more. Schools should be responsible for what happens there and not make it worse for students outside of school. """"",3,3,3,4,3,4,4

 This is said in the text stating Â¨the ban on suspensions would remove an important tool that teachers use to maintain classroom order.Â¨ This supports my claim because when there is a disruptive student that can't be suspended they just make a bad work environment. 
 
 In the text they say Â¨School systems that cut back on suspensions should also see an increase in academic achievement.Â¨ This claim as their maybe students that learn better in this environment their are bound to be students that don't work at all in these environments the text states this by saying Â¨This leads to a poor work environment for teachers and a weak academic climate for students.Â¨
 
 This supports my claim that not having suspension makes a bad environment because teachers can't make order in their classrooms making the class less disruptive and the students academic level because the teacher cant teach and the students have no reason to stop being disruptive countering the counterclaim

Children need summer vacation. Schools getting rid of summer vacation, to me, is ridiculous. If you think they should, I don't agree with you, but I won't judge you.
 
 There are multiple reasons why schools shouldn't get rid of summer vacation. My main reason is that owners of camps rely on children coming for the summer to get their income, if we get rid of summer vacation, those people will have to find another job and that can be hard. In the text it says ""Many young people use their time off to work in order to support themselves and their families."" If we get rid of summer vacation these people can't help their family with money issues, they may be able to work during the school week, but it would be very difficult.
 
 I can see why a person would want to have more breaks throughout the year. They want to go on vacation more than one time a year, but there are other breaks that kids get throughout the year, like fall break, Thanksgiving, Winter, and Spring break. These breaks may not be as long as you would like, but breaks like Thanksgiving, Winter, or Spring you can still go to different places in the country.
